	Abstract = {Current and future surveys of large-scale cosmic structure are associated with a massive and complex datastream to study, characterize, and ultimately understand the physics behind the two major components of the 'Dark Universe', dark energy and dark matter. In addition, the surveys also probe primordial perturbations and carry out fundamental measurements, such as determining the sum of neutrino masses. Large-scale simulations of structure formation in the Universe play a critical role in the interpretation of the data and extraction of the physics of interest. Just as survey instruments continue to grow in size and complexity, so do the supercomputers that enable these simulations. Here we report on HACC (Hardware/Hybrid Accelerated Cosmology Code), a recently developed and evolving cosmology N-body code framework, designed to run efficiently on diverse computing architectures and to scale to millions of cores and beyond. HACC can run on all current supercomputer architectures and supports a variety of programming models and algorithms. It has been demonstrated at scale on Cell- and GPU-accelerated systems, standard multi-core node clusters, and Blue Gene systems. HACC's design allows for ease of portability, and at the same time, high levels of sustained performance on the fastest supercomputers available. We present a description of the design philosophy of HACC, the underlying algorithms and code structure, and outline implementation details for several specific architectures. We show selected accuracy and performance results from some of the largest high resolution cosmological simulations so far performed, including benchmarks evolving more than 3.6 trillion particles.},

	Abstract = {Euclid is a space-based survey mission from the European Space Agency designed to understand the origin of the Universe's accelerating expansion. It will use cosmological probes to investigate the nature of dark energy, dark matter and gravity by tracking their observational signatures on the geometry of the universe and on the cosmic history of structure formation. The mission is optimised for two independent primary cosmological probes: Weak gravitational Lensing (WL) and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). The Euclid payload consists of a 1.2 m Korsch telescope designed to provide a large field of view. It carries two instruments with a common field-of-view of ~0.54 deg2: the visual imager (VIS) and the near infrared instrument (NISP) which contains a slitless spectrometer and a three bands photometer. The Euclid wide survey will cover 15,000 deg2 of the extragalactic sky and is complemented by two 20 deg2 deep fields. For WL, Euclid measures the shapes of 30-40 resolved galaxies per arcmin2 in one broad visible R+I+Z band (550-920 nm). The photometric redshifts for these galaxies reach a precision of dz/(1+z) < 0.05. They are derived from three additional Euclid NIR bands (Y, J, H in the range 0.92-2.0 micron), complemented by ground based photometry in visible bands derived from public data or through engaged collaborations. The BAO are determined from a spectroscopic survey with a redshift accuracy dz/(1+z) =0.001. The slitless spectrometer, with spectral resolution ~250, predominantly detects Ha emission line galaxies. Euclid is a Medium Class mission of the ESA Cosmic Vision 2015-2025 programme, with a foreseen launch date in 2019. This report (also known as the Euclid Red Book) describes the outcome of the Phase A study.},

	Abstract = {The Astro2010 Decadal Survey recommended a Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) as its top priority for a new large space mission. The report of the WFIRST-AFTA Science Definition Team (SDT) presents a Design Reference Mission for WFIRST that employs one of the 2.4-m, Hubble-quality mirror assemblies recently made available to NASA. The 2.4-m primary mirror enables a mission with greater sensitivity and higher angular resolution than the smaller aperture designs previously considered for WFIRST, increasing both the science return of the primary surveys and the capabilities of WFIRST as a Guest Observer facility. The option of adding an on-axis, coronagraphic instrument would enable imaging and spectroscopic studies of planets around nearby stars. This short article, produced as a companion to the SDT report, summarizes the key points of the WFIRST-2.4 DRM. It highlights the remarkable opportunity that the 2.4-m telescope affords for advances in many fields of astrophysics and cosmology, including dark energy, the demographics and characterization of exoplanets, the evolution of galaxies and quasars, and the stellar populations of the Milky Way and its neighbors.},

@article{Ivezic:2008tv,
	Abstract = {(Abridged) We describe here the most ambitious survey currently planned in the optical, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). A vast array of science will be enabled by a single wide-deep-fast sky survey, and LSST will have unique survey capability in the faint time domain. The LSST design is driven by four main science themes: probing dark energy and dark matter, taking an inventory of the Solar System, exploring the transient optical sky, and mapping the Milky Way. LSST will be a wide-field ground-based system designed to obtain multiple images covering the sky visible from Cerro Pach\'{o}n in northern Chile. The telescope will have an 8.4 m (6.5 m effective) primary mirror, a 9.6 deg$^2$ field of view, and a 3.2 Gigapixel camera. This system can image about 10,000 square degrees of sky in three clear nights using pairs of 15-second exposures twice per night, with typical 5$\sigma$ depth for point sources of $r\sim24.5$ (AB). The project is in the construction phase and will begin regular survey operations by 2022. The survey area will be contained within 30,000 deg$^2$ with $\delta<+34.5^\circ$, and will be imaged multiple times in six bands, $ugrizy$, covering the wavelength range 320--1050 nm. About 90\% of the observing time will be devoted to a deep-wide-fast survey mode which will uniformly observe a 18,000 deg$^2$ region about 800 times (summed over all six bands) during the anticipated 10 years of operations, and yield a coadded map to $r\sim27.5$. The remaining 10\% of the observing time will be allocated to projects such as a Very Deep and Fast time domain survey. The goal is to make LSST data products, including a relational database of about 32 trillion observations of 40 billion objects, available to the public and scientists around the world.},

	Abstract = {Strong gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters is a fundamental tool to study dark matter and constrain the geometry of the Universe. Recently, the Hubble Space Telescope Frontier Fields programme has allowed a significant improvement of mass and magnification measurements but lensing models still have a residual root mean square between 0.2 arcsec and few arcseconds, not yet completely understood. Systematic errors have to be better understood and treated in order to use strong lensing clusters as reliable cosmological probes. We have analysed two simulated Hubble-Frontier-Fields-like clusters from the Hubble Frontier Fields Comparison Challenge, Ares and Hera. We use several estimators (relative bias on magnification, density profiles, ellipticity and orientation) to quantify the goodness of our reconstructions by comparing our multiple models, optimized with the parametric software lenstool, with the input models. We have quantified the impact of systematic errors arising, first, from the choice of different density profiles and configurations and, secondly, from the availability of constraints (spectroscopic or photometric redshifts, redshift ranges of the background sources) in the parametric modelling of strong lensing galaxy clusters and therefore on the retrieval of cosmological parameters. We find that substructures in the outskirts have a significant impact on the position of the multiple images, yielding tighter cosmological contours. The need for wide-field imaging around massive clusters is thus reinforced. We show that competitive cosmological constraints can be obtained also with complex multimodal clusters and that photometric redshifts improve the constraints on cosmological parameters when considering a narrow range of (spectroscopic) redshifts for the sources.},

	Abstract = {We report the spectroscopic confirmation of 22 new multiply lensed sources behind the Hubble Frontier Field (HFF) galaxy cluster MACS J0416.1-2403 (MACS 0416), using archival data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the VLT. Combining with previous spectroscopic measurements of 15 other multiply imaged sources, we have obtained a sample of 102 secure multiple images with measured redshifts, the largest to date in a single strong lensing system. The newly confirmed sources are largely low-luminosity Lyman-alpha emitters with redshift in the range [ 3.08-6.15 ]. With such a large number of secure constraints, and a significantly improved sample of galaxy members in the cluster core, we have improved our previous strong lensing model and obtained a robust determination of the projected total mass distribution of MACS 0416. We find evidence of three cored dark-matter halos, adding to the known complexity of this merging system. The total mass density profile, as well as the sub-halo population, are found to be in good agreement with previous works. We update and make public the redshift catalog of MACS 0416 from our previous spectroscopic campaign with the new MUSE redshifts. We also release lensing maps (convergence, shear, magnification) in the standard HFF format.  Source catalog (full Table A.2) is only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (http://130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/600/A90},

	Abstract = {Gravitational lensing by clusters of galaxies offers a powerful probe of their structure and mass distribution. Several research groups have developed techniques independently to achieve this goal. While these methods have all provided remarkably high-precision mass maps, particularly with exquisite imaging data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), the reconstructions themselves have never been directly compared. In this paper, we present for the first time a detailed comparison of methodologies for fidelity, accuracy and precision. For this collaborative exercise, the lens modelling community was provided simulated cluster images that mimic the depth and resolution of the ongoing HST Frontier Fields. The results of the submitted reconstructions with the un-blinded true mass profile of these two clusters are presented here. Parametric, free-form and hybrid techniques have been deployed by the participating groups and we detail the strengths and trade-offs in accuracy and systematics that arise for each methodology. We note in conclusion that several properties of the lensing clusters are recovered equally well by most of the lensing techniques compared in this study. For example, the reconstruction of azimuthally averaged density and mass profiles by both parametric and free-form methods matches the input models at the level of ~10 per cent. Parametric techniques are generally better at recovering the 2D maps of the convergence and of the magnification. For the best-performing algorithms, the accuracy in the magnification estimate is ~10 per cent at mutrue = 3 and it degrades to ~30 per cent at mutrue ~ 10.},

	Abstract = {We report on the galaxy MACSJ0032-arc at zCO = 3.6314 discovered during the Herschel Lensing snapshot Survey of massive galaxy clusters, and strongly lensed by the cluster MACS J0032.1+1808. The successful detections of its rest-frame ultraviolet (UV), optical, far-infrared (FIR), millimeter, and radio continua, and of its CO emission enable us to characterize, for the first time at such a high redshift, the stellar, dust, and molecular gas properties of a compact star-forming galaxy with a size smaller than 2.5 kpc, a fairly low stellar mass of 4.8+ 0.5-1.0 × 109M&sun;, and a moderate IR luminosity of 4.8+ 1.2-0.6 × 1011L&sun;. By combining the stretching effect of the lens with the high angular resolution imaging of the CO(1-0) line emission and the radio continuum at 5 GHz, we find that the bulk of the molecular gas mass and star formation seems to be spatially decoupled from the rest-frame UV emission. About 90% of the total star formation rate is undetected at rest-frame UV wavelengths because of severe obscuration by dust, but is seen through the thermal FIR dust emission and the radio synchrotron radiation. The observed CO(4-3) and CO(6-5) lines demonstrate that high-J transitions, at least up to J = 6, remain excited in this galaxy, whose CO spectral line energy distribution resembles that of high-redshift submm galaxies, even though the IR luminosity of MACSJ0032-arc is ten times lower. This high CO excitation is possibly due to the compactness of the galaxy. We find evidence that this high CO excitation has to be considered in the balance when estimating the CO-to-H2 conversion factor. Indeed, the respective CO-to-H2 conversion factors as derived from the correlation with metallicity and the FIR dust continuum can only be reconciled if excitation is accounted for. The inferred depletion time of the molecular gas in MACSJ0032-arc supports the decrease in the gas depletion timescale of galaxies with redshift, although to a lesser degree than predicted by galaxy evolution models. Instead, the measured molecular gas fraction as high as 60-79% in MACSJ0032-arc favors the continued increase in the gas fraction of galaxies with redshift as expected, despite the plateau observed between z   1.5 and z   2.5.

@article{Lam:2014dd,
	Abstract = {Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) imaging of the most powerful lensing clusters provides access to the most magnified distant galaxies. The challenge is to construct lens models capable of describing these complex massive, merging clusters so that individual lensed systems can be reliably identified and their intrinsic properties accurately derived. We apply the free-form lensing method (WSLAP+) to A2744, providing a model independent map of the cluster mass, magnification, and geometric distance estimates to multiply lensed sources. We solve simultaneously for a smooth cluster component on a pixel grid, together with local deflections by the cluster member galaxies. Combining model prediction with photometric redshift measurements, we correct and complete several systems recently claimed and identify four new systems totaling 65 images of 21 systems spanning a redshift range of 1.4 < z < 9.8. The reconstructed mass shows small enhancements in the directions where significant amounts of hot plasma can be seen in X-ray. We compare photometric redshifts with "geometric redshifts," finding a high level of self-consistency. We find excellent agreement between predicted and observed fluxes with a best-fit slope of 0.999 $\pm$ 0.013 and an rms of ~0.25 mag, demonstrating that our magnification correction of the lensed background galaxies is very reliable. Intriguingly, few multiply lensed galaxies are detected beyond z ~= 7.0, despite the high magnification and the limiting redshift of z ~= 11.5 permitted by the HFF filters. With the additional HFF clusters, we can better examine the plausibility of any pronounced high-z deficit with potentially important implications for the reionization epoch and the nature of dark matter.},

	Abstract = {We present a detailed mass reconstruction and a novel study on the substructure properties in the core of the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH) and Frontier Fields galaxy cluster MACS J0416.1-2403. We show and employ our extensive spectroscopic data set taken with the VIsible Multi-Object Spectrograph instrument as part of our CLASH-VLT program, to confirm spectroscopically 10 strong lensing systems and to select a sample of 175 plausible cluster members to a limiting stellar mass of log (M */M &sun;) ~= 8.6. We reproduce the measured positions of a set of 30 multiple images with a remarkable median offset of only 0.''3 by means of a comprehensive strong lensing model comprised of two cluster dark-matter halos, represented by cored elliptical pseudo-isothermal mass distributions, and the cluster member components, parameterized with dual pseudo-isothermal total mass profiles. The latter have total mass-to-light ratios increasing with the galaxy HST/WFC3 near-IR (F160W) luminosities. The measurement of the total enclosed mass within the Einstein radius is accurate to ~5%, including the systematic uncertainties estimated from six distinct mass models. We emphasize that the use of multiple-image systems with spectroscopic redshifts and knowledge of cluster membership based on extensive spectroscopic information is key to constructing robust high-resolution mass maps. We also produce magnification maps over the central area that is covered with HST observations. We investigate the galaxy contribution, both in terms of total and stellar mass, to the total mass budget of the cluster. When compared with the outcomes of cosmological N-body simulations, our results point to a lack of massive subhalos in the inner regions of simulated clusters with total masses similar to that of MACS J0416.1-2403. Our findings of the location and shape of the cluster dark-matter halo density profiles and on the cluster substructures provide intriguing tests of the assumed collisionless, cold nature of dark matter and of the role played by baryons in the process of structure formation.  This work is based in large part on data collected at ESO VLT (prog. ID 186.A-0798) and NASA HST.},

	Abstract = {We present a revised lens model of MACS J1149+2223, in which the first resolved multiply imaged lensed supernova (SN) was discovered. The lens model is based on the model of Johnson et al. with some modifications. We include more lensing constraints from the host galaxy of the newly discovered SN, and increase the flexibility of the model in order to better reproduce the lensing signal in the vicinity of this galaxy. The revised model accurately reconstructs the positions of the lensed SN, provides magnifications, and predicts the time delay between the instances of the SN. Finally, we reconstruct the source image of the host galaxy, and position the SN on one of its spiral arms. Products of this lens model are available to the community through MAST.

	Abstract = {Cluster gravitational lensing surveys like the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Frontier Fields survey will detect distant galaxies 10-50 times fainter than any yet discovered. Using these surveys to measure the luminosity function of such faint, distant galaxies, however, requires that magnification maps built from the constraints of strongly lensed images be accurate. For models that assume the cluster and nearby (correlated) structures are the only significant sources of lensing, a potential source of error in these maps comes from the fact that light rays also suffer weak deflections by uncorrelated large-scale structure along the line of sight, i.e. cosmic weak lensing (CWL). To demonstrate the magnitude of this effect, we calculate the magnification change which results when the same cluster lens is placed along different lines of sight. Using a simple density profile for a cluster lens at z ˜ 0.3-0.5 and the power spectrum of the matter density fluctuations responsible for CWL, we show that the typical magnifications of ˜5(10) of sources at z = 6-10 can differ by ˜10-20(20-30) per cent from one line of sight to another. However, these fluctuations rise to greater than order unity near critical curves, indicating that CWL tends to make its greatest contribution to the most magnified images. We conclude that the neglect of CWL in determining the intrinsic luminosities of highly magnified galaxies may introduce errors significant enough to warrant further effort to include this contribution in cluster-lens modelling. We suggest that methods of modelling CWL in galaxy-strong-lensing systems should be generalized to cluster-lensing systems.},

	Abstract = {We present a revised strong lensing mass reconstruction of the galaxy cluster RX J1347.5-1145. The X-ray luminous cluster at redshift z = 0.451 has already been studied intensively in the past. Based on information of two such previous (strong-) lensing studies by Halkola et al. and Bradac et al., as well as by incorporating newly available data from the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble, we identified four systems of multiply lensed images (anew) in the redshift range 1.75 <= z <= 4.19. One multiple image system consists of in total eight multiply lensed images of the same source. The analysis based on a parametric mass model derived with the software GLAFIC suggests that the high image multiplicity is due to the source (zphot = 4.19) being located on a so-called `swallowtail' caustic. In addition to the parametric mass model, we also employed a non-parametric approach using the software PIXELENS in order to reconstruct the projected mass of the cluster using the same strong lensing data input. Both reconstructed mass models agree in revealing several mass components and a highly elliptic shape of the mass distribution. Furthermore, the projected mass inside, for example, a radius R ˜ 35 arcsec ˜ 200 kpc of the cluster for a source at redshift z = 1.75 is M(<R) ≈ (2.19^{+0.01}_{-0.02}) × 10^{14} {M_{{&sun;}}} as estimated by GLAFIC. Within the same radius PIXELENS predicts a mass of M(<R) ≈ (2.47 $\pm$ 0.01) × 10^{14} {M_{{&sun;}}} which exceeds the GLAFIC estimate by ˜13 per cent. The difference could be related to the fundamental degeneracy involved when constraining dark matter substructures with gravitationally lensed arcs.},

	Abstract = {We present a strong lensing analysis on the massive cluster Abell 370 (A370; z = 0.375), using a combination of deep multiband Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging and Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) spectroscopy. From only 2 h of the MUSE data, we are able to measure 120 redshifts in the southern BCG area, including several multiply imaged lens systems. In total, we increase the number of multiply imaged systems with a secure redshift from 4 to 15, nine of which are newly discovered. Of these, eight are located at z > 3, greatly extending the redshift range of spectroscopically confirmed systems over previous work. Using these systems as constraints, we update a parametric lens model of A370, probing the mass distribution from cluster to galaxy scales. Overall, we find that a model with only two cluster-scale dark matter haloes (one for each BCG) does a poor job of fitting these new image constraints. Instead, two additional mass clumps - a central `bar' of mass located between the BCGs, and another clump located within a `crown' of galaxies in the northern part of the cluster field - provide significant improvements to the fit. Additional physical evidence suggests these clumps are indeed real features of the system, but with relatively few image constraints in the crown region, this claim is difficult to evaluate from a modelling perspective. Additional MUSE observations of A370 covering the entire strong-lensing region will greatly help these efforts, further improving our understanding of this intriguing cluster.},

	Abstract = {Surveys with submillimetre telescopes are revealing large numbers of gravitationally lensed high-redshift sources. I describe how, in practice, these lensed systems could be simultaneously used to estimate the values of cosmological parameters, test models for the evolution of the distribution of dark-matter haloes and investigate the properties of the source population. Even the existing sample of lenses found with the Herschel Space Observatory is enough to formally rule out the standard models of the evolving population of dark-matter haloes, with the likely explanation a combination of baryon physics and the perturbation by infalling baryons of the density distribution of dark matter at the centres of the haloes. Independently of the evolution of the haloes, observations of a sample of 100 lensed systems would be enough to estimate OmegaLambda with a precision of 5 per cent and observations of 1000 lenses would be enough to estimate w, the parameter in the equation of state of dark energy, with a precision similar to that obtained from the Planck observations of the cosmic microwave background. While the fraction of submillimetre sources that are lensed depends weakly on the specific halo mass function that is used in the model, it depends very strongly on the evolution of the submillimetre luminosity function of the source population. Therefore measurements of the lensing fraction could be used to investigate galaxy evolution in a way that is independent of the properties of the intervening haloes.},

	Abstract = {In Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging taken on 2014 November 10, four images of supernova (SN) ``Refsdal'' (redshift z = 1.49) appeared in an Einstein-cross-like configuration (images S1-S4) around an early-type galaxy in the cluster MACS J1149.5+2223 (z = 0.54). Almost all lens models of the cluster have predicted that the SN should reappear within a year in a second host-galaxy image created by the cluster's potential. In HST observations taken on 2015 December 11, we find a new source at the predicted position of the new image of SN Refsdal approximately 8\prime\prime  from the previous images S1-S4. This marks the first time the appearance of a SN at a particular time and location in the sky was successfully predicted in advance! We use these data and the light curve from the first four observed images of SN Refsdal to place constraints on the relative time delay and magnification of the new image (SX) compared to images S1-S4. This enables us, for the first time, to test ``blind'' lens model predictions of both magnifications and time delays for a lensed SN. We find that the timing and brightness of the new image are consistent with the blind predictions of a fraction of the models. The reappearance illustrates the discriminatory power of this blind test and its utility to uncover sources of systematic uncertainty. From planned HST photometry, we expect to reach a precision of 1%-2% on the time delay between S1-S4 and SX.},

	Abstract = {We present a high-precision mass model of the galaxy cluster MACS J1149.6+ 2223, based on a strong gravitational lensing analysis of Hubble Space Telescope Frontier Fields (HFF) imaging data and spectroscopic follow-up with Gemini/Gemini Multi-Object Spectrographs (GMOS) and Very Large Telescope (VLT)/Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). Our model includes 12 new multiply imaged galaxies, bringing the total to 22, composed of 65 individual lensed images. Unlike the first two HFF clusters, Abell 2744 and MACS J0416.1-2403, MACS J1149 does not reveal as many multiple images in the HFF data. Using the LENSTOOL software package and the new sets of multiple images, we model the cluster with several cluster-scale dark matter haloes and additional galaxy-scale haloes for the cluster members. Consistent with previous analyses, we find the system to be complex, composed of five cluster-scale haloes. Their spatial distribution and lower mass, however, makes MACS J1149 a less powerful lens. Our best-fitting model predicts image positions with an rms of 0.91 arcsec. We measure the total projected mass inside a 200-kpc aperture as (1.840 $\pm$ 0.006) × 1014 M&sun;, thus reaching again 1 per cent precision, following our previous HFF analyses of MACS J0416.1-2403 and Abell 2744. In light of the discovery of the first resolved quadruply lensed supernova, SN Refsdal, in one of the multiply imaged galaxies identified in MACS J1149, we use our revised mass model to investigate the time delays and predict the rise of the next image between 2015 November and 2016 January.},

	Abstract = {We construct a mass model of the cluster MACS J1149.6+2223 to study the expected properties of multiple images of SN Refsdal, the first example of a gravitationally lensed supernova with resolved multiple images recently reported by Kelly et al. We find that the best-fitting model predicts six supernova images in total, i.e. two extra images in addition to the observed four Einstein cross supernova images S1-S4. One extra image is predicted to have appeared about 17 years ago, whereas the other extra image is predicted to appear in about one year from the appearance of S1-S4, which is a testable prediction with near-future observations. The predicted magnification factors of individual supernova images range from ˜18 for the brightest image to ˜4 for the faint extra images. Confronting these predictions with future observations should provide an unprecedented opportunity to improve our understanding of cluster mass distributions.},

	Abstract = {We have acquired Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Very Large Telescope near-infrared spectra and images of supernova (SN) Refsdal after its discovery as an Einstein cross in fall 2014. The HST light curve of SN Refsdal has a shape consistent with the distinctive, slowly rising light curves of SN 1987A-like SNe, and we find strong evidence for a broad Halpha P-Cygni profile and Na I D absorption in the HST grism spectrum at the redshift (z = 1.49) of the spiral host galaxy. SNe IIn, largely powered by circumstellar interaction, could provide a good match to the light curve of SN Refsdal, but the spectrum of a SN IIn would not show broad and strong Halpha and Na I D absorption. From the grism spectrum, we measure an Halpha expansion velocity consistent with those of SN 1987A-like SNe at a similar phase. The luminosity, evolution, and Gaussian profile of the Halpha emission of the WFC3 and X-shooter spectra, separated by ˜2.5 months in the rest frame, provide additional evidence that supports the SN 1987A-like classification. In comparison with other examples of SN 1987A-like SNe, photometry of SN Refsdal favors bluer B - V and V - R colors and one of the largest luminosities for the assumed range of potential magnifications. The evolution of the light curve at late times will provide additional evidence about the potential existence of any substantial circumstellar material. Using MOSFIRE and X-shooter spectra, we estimate a subsolar host-galaxy metallicity (8.3 $\pm$ 0.1 dex and <8.4 dex, respectively) near the explosion site.},

	Abstract = {We present the first year of Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the unique supernova (SN) ``Refsdal,'' a gravitationally lensed SN at z = 1.488 $\pm$ 0.001 with multiple images behind the galaxy cluster MACS J1149.6+2223. The first four observed images of SN Refsdal (images S1-S4) exhibited a slow rise (over ˜150 days) to reach a broad peak brightness around 2015 April 20. Using a set of light curve templates constructed from SN 1987A-like peculiar Type II SNe, we measure time delays for the four images relative to S1 of 4 $\pm$ 4 (for S2), 2 $\pm$ 5 (S3), and 24 $\pm$ 7 days (S4). The measured magnification ratios relative to S1 are 1.15 $\pm$ 0.05 (S2), 1.01 $\pm$ 0.04 (S3), and 0.34 $\pm$ 0.02 (S4). None of the template light curves fully captures the photometric behavior of SN Refsdal, so we also derive complementary measurements for these parameters using polynomials to represent the intrinsic light curve shape. These more flexible fits deliver fully consistent time delays of 7 $\pm$ 2 (S2), 0.6 $\pm$ 3 (S3), and 27 $\pm$ 8 days (S4). The lensing magnification ratios are similarly consistent, measured as 1.17 $\pm$ 0.02 (S2), 1.00 $\pm$ 0.01 (S3), and 0.38 $\pm$ 0.02 (S4). We compare these measurements against published predictions from lens models, and find that the majority of model predictions are in very good agreement with our measurements. Finally, we discuss avenues for future improvement of time delay measurements---both for SN Refsdal and for other strongly lensed SNe yet to come.},

	Abstract = {In 1964, Refsdal hypothesized that a supernova whose light traversed multiple paths around a strong gravitational lens could be used to measure the rate of cosmic expansion. We report the discovery of such a system. In Hubble Space Telescope imaging, we have found four images of a single supernova forming an Einstein cross configuration around a redshift z = 0.54 elliptical galaxy in the MACS J1149.6+2223 cluster. The cluster's gravitational potential also creates multiple images of the z = 1.49 spiral supernova host galaxy, and a future appearance of the supernova elsewhere in the cluster field is expected. The magnifications and staggered arrivals of the supernova images probe the cosmic expansion rate, as well as the distribution of matter in the galaxy and cluster lenses.},

	Abstract = {We present a joint optical/X-ray analysis of the massive galaxy cluster Abell 2744 (z = 0.308). Our strong- and weak-lensing analysis within the central region of the cluster, I.e. at R < 1 Mpc from the brightest cluster galaxy, reveals eight substructures, including the main core. All of these dark matter haloes are detected with a significance of at least 5sigma and feature masses ranging from 0.5 to 1.4 × 1014 M&sun; within R < 150 kpc. Merten et al. and Medezinski et al. substructures are also detected by us. We measure a slightly higher mass for the main core component than reported previously and attribute the discrepancy to the inclusion of our tightly constrained strong-lensing mass model built on Hubble Frontier Fields data. X-ray data obtained by XMM-Newton reveal four remnant cores, one of them a new detection, and three shocks. Unlike Merten et al., we find all cores to have both dark and luminous counterparts. A comparison with clusters of similar mass in the Millennium XXL simulations yields no objects with as many massive substructures as observed in Abell 2744, confirming that Abell 2744 is an extreme system. We stress that these properties still do not constitute a challenge to Lambda cold dark matter, as caveats apply to both the simulation and the observations: for instance, the projected mass measurements from gravitational lensing and the limited resolution of the subhaloes finders. We discuss implications of Abell 2744 for the plausibility of different dark matter candidates and, finally, measure a new upper limit on the self-interaction cross-section of dark matter of sigmaDM < 1.28 cm2 g-1 (68 per cent CL), in good agreement with previous results from Harvey et al.},

	Abstract = {We map the lensing-inferred substructure in the first three clusters observed by the Hubble Space Telescope Frontier Fields (HSTFF) Initiative: Abell 2744 (z = 0.308), MACSJ 0416, (z = 0.396) and MACSJ 1149 (z = 0.543). Statistically resolving dark matter subhaloes down to ˜10^{9.5} M_{&sun;}, we compare the derived subhalo mass functions (SHMFs) to theoretical predictions from analytical models and with numerical simulations in a Lambda cold dark matter (LCDM) cosmology. Mimicking our observational cluster member selection criteria in the HSTFF, we report excellent agreement in both amplitude and shape of the SHMF over four decades in subhalo mass (10^{9-13} M_{&sun;}). Projection effects do not appear to introduce significant errors in the determination of SHMFs from simulations. We do not find evidence for a substructure crisis, analogous to the missing satellite problem in the Local Group, on cluster scales, but rather excellent agreement of the count-matched HSTFF SHMF down to Msubhalo/Mhalo ˜ 10-5. However, we do find discrepancies in the radial distribution of subhaloes inferred from HSTFF cluster lenses compared to determinations from simulated clusters. This suggests that although the selected simulated clusters match the HSTFF sample in mass, they do not adequately capture the dynamical properties and complex merging morphologies of these observed cluster lenses. Therefore, HSTFF clusters are likely observed in a transient evolutionary stage that is presently insufficiently sampled in cosmological simulations. The abundance and mass function of dark matter substructure in cluster lenses continues to offer an important test of the LCDM paradigm, and at present we find no tension between model predictions and observations.},

	Abstract = {The Hubble Frontier Fields (HFFs) are six clusters of galaxies, all showing indications of recent mergers, which have recently been observed for lensed images. As such they are the natural laboratories to study the merging history of galaxy clusters. In this work, we explore the 2D power spectrum of the mass distribution PM(k) as a measure of substructure. We compare PM(k) of these clusters (obtained using strong gravitational lensing) to that of Lambda cold dark matter simulated clusters of similar mass. To compute lensing PM(k), we produced free-form lensing mass reconstructions of HFF clusters, without any light traces mass (LTM) assumption. The inferred power at small scales tends to be larger if (I) the cluster is at lower redshift, and/or (II) there are deeper observations and hence more lensed images. In contrast, lens reconstructions assuming LTM show higher power at small scales even with fewer lensed images; it appears the small-scale power in the LTM reconstructions is dominated by light information, rather than the lensing data. The average lensing derived PM(k) shows lower power at small scales as compared to that of simulated clusters at redshift zero, both dark matter only and hydrodynamical. The possible reasons are (I) the available strong lensing data are limited in their effective spatial resolution on the mass distribution; (II) HFF clusters have yet to build the small-scale power they would have at z ˜ 0 or (III) simulations are somehow overestimating the small-scale power.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the intracluster light (ICL) in the six Hubble Frontier Field clusters at 0.3< z< 0.6. We employ a new method, which is free from any functional form of the ICL profile, and exploit the unprecedented depth of this Hubble Space Telescope imaging to map the ICL's diffuse light out to clustrocentric radii R˜ 300 {kpc} ({mu }{ICL}˜ 27 mag arcsec-2). From these maps, we construct radial color and stellar mass profiles via SED fitting and find clear negative color gradients in all systems with increasing distance from the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG). While this implies older/more metal-rich stellar components in the inner part of the ICL, we find that the ICL mostly consists of a ≲ 2 {Gyr} population, and plausibly originated with {log}{M}* /{M}&sun; ≲ 10 cluster galaxies. Furthermore, we find that 10%-15% of the ICL's mass at large radii (≳ 150 kpc) lies in a younger/bluer stellar population (˜1 Gyr), a phenomenon not seen in local samples. We attribute this light to the higher fraction of star-forming/(post-)starburst galaxies in clusters at z˜ 0.5. Ultimately, we find the ICL's total mass to be {log}{M}* {ICL}/{M}&sun; ˜ 11-12, constituting 5%-20% of the clusters' total stellar mass, or about half of the value at z˜ 0. The above implies distinct formation histories for the ICL and BCGs/other massive cluster galaxies; I.e., the ICL at this epoch is still being constructed rapidly (˜ 40 {M}&sun;  yr-1), while the BCGs have mostly completed their evolution. To be consistent with the ICL measurements of local massive clusters, such as Virgo, our data suggest mass acquisition mainly from quiescent cluster galaxies is the principal source of ICL material in the subsequent ˜5 Gyr of cosmic time.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the sizes of z ˜ 6-8 dropout galaxies using the complete data of the Abell 2744 cluster and parallel fields in the Hubble Frontier Fields program. By directly fitting light profiles of observed galaxies with lensing-distorted S{\'e}rsic profiles on the image plane with the glafic software, we accurately measure intrinsic sizes of 31 z ˜ 6-7 and 8 z˜ 8 galaxies, including those as faint as {{M}UV}~= -16.6. We find that half-light radii re positively correlates with UV luminosity at each redshift, although the correlation is not very tight. The largest ({{r}e}\gt 0.8 kpc) galaxies are mostly red in UV color while the smallest ({{r}e}\lt 0.08 kpc) ones tend to be blue. We also find that galaxies with multiple cores tend to be brighter. Combined with previous results at 2.5≲ z≲ 12, our result confirms that the average {{r}e} of bright ((0.3-1)Lz=3*) galaxies scales as {{r}e}\propto {{<=ft( 1+z \right)}-m} with m=1.24+/- 0.1. We find that the ratio of re to virial radius is virtually constant at 3.3 $\pm$ 0.1% over a wide redshift range, where the virial radii of hosting dark matter halos are derived based on the abundance matching. This constant ratio is consistent with the disk formation model by Mo et al. with {{j}d}˜ {{m}d}, where jd and md are the fractions of the angular momentum and mass within halos confined in the disks. A comparison with various types of local galaxies indicates that our galaxies are most similar to circumnuclear star-forming regions of barred galaxies in the sense that a sizable amount of stars are forming in a very small area.},

@article{Bouwens:2017to,
	Abstract = {We provide the first observational constraints on the sizes of the faintest galaxies lensed by the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) clusters. Ionizing radiation from faint galaxies likely drives cosmic reionization, and the HFF initiative provides a key opportunity to find such galaxies. However, we cannot assess their ionizing emissivity without a robust measurement of their sizes, since this is key to quantifying both their prevalence and the faint-end slope to the UV luminosity function. Here we provide the first size constraints with two new techniques. The first utilizes the fact that the detectability of highly magnified galaxies as a function of shear is very dependent on a galaxy's size. Only the most compact galaxies remain detectable in high-shear regions (versus a larger detectable size range for low shear), a phenomenon we quantify using simulations. Remarkably, however, no correlation is found between the surface density of faint galaxies and the predicted shear, using 87 high-magnification (mu =10-100) z˜ 2-8 galaxies seen behind the first four HFF clusters. This can only be the case if faint (˜ -15 mag) galaxies have significantly smaller sizes than more luminous galaxies, I.e., ≲ 30 mas or 160-240 pc. As a second size probe, we rotate and stack 26 faint high-magnification sources along the major shear axis. Less elongation is found even for objects with an intrinsic half-light radius of 10 mas. Together, these results indicate that extremely faint z˜ 2-8 galaxies have near point-source profiles (half-light radii <30 mas and perhaps 5-10 mas). These results suggest smaller completeness corrections and hence shallower faint-end slopes for the z˜ 2-8 LFs than derived in some recent studies (by {{Delta }}alpha ≳ 0.1-0.3).},

	Abstract = {We construct $z\sim6-7$, 8, and 9 faint Lyman break galaxy samples (334, 61, and 37 galaxies, respectively) with accurate size measurements with the software $\texttt{glafic}$ from the complete Hubble Frontier Fields (FF) cluster and parallel fields data. These are the largest samples hitherto and reach down to the faint ends of recently obtained deep luminosity functions. At faint magnitudes, however, these samples are highly incomplete for galaxies with large sizes, implying that derivation of the luminosity function (LF) sensitively depends on the intrinsic size--luminosity (RL) relation. We thus conduct simultaneous maximum-likelihood estimation of LF and RL relation parameters from the observed distribution of galaxies on the RL plane with help of a completeness map as a function of size and luminosity. At $z\sim6-7$, we find that the intrinsic RL relation expressed as $r_\textrm{e} \propto L^\beta$ has a notably steeper slope of $\beta=0.46^{+0.08}_{-0.09}$ than those at lower redshifts, which in turn implies that the LF has a relatively shallow faint-end slope of $\alpha=-1.86^{+0.17}_{-0.18}$. This steep $\beta$ can be reproduced by a simple analytical model in which smaller galaxies have lower specific angular momenta. The $\beta$ and $\alpha$ values for the $z\sim8$ and 9 samples are consistent with those for $z\sim6-7$ but with larger errors. For all three samples there is a large, positive covariance between $\beta$ and $\alpha$, implying that the simultaneous determination of these two parameters is important. We also provide new strong lens mass models of Abell S1063 and Abell 370 as well as updated mass models of Abell 2744 and MACS J0416.1$-$2403.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of a search for z = 9-10 galaxies within the first eight pointings of the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) survey and 20 cluster fields from the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH) survey. Combined with our previous analysis of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, we have now completed a search for z = 9-10 galaxies over ~= 130 arcmin2, spread across 29 Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3/IR pointings. We confine our primary search for high-redshift candidates in this imaging to the uniformly deep, relatively low magnification regions (I.e. sigma160 > 30 AB mag for HFF and sigma160 > 28.8 AB mag for CLASH in 0.5-arcsec apertures). We unveil a sample of 33 galaxy candidates at zphot >= 8.4, five of which have primary photometric redshift solutions in the range 9.6 < zphot < 11.2. The improved statistics and reduced cosmic variance provided by our new sample allows a more accurate determination of the ultraviolet (UV)-selected galaxy luminosity function (LF) at z ~= 9. Our new results strengthen our previous conclusion that the LF appears to evolve smoothly from z = 8 to 9, an evolution which can be equally well modelled by a factor of ~= 2 drop in density, or a dimming of ~= 0.5 mag in M*. Moreover, we are able to place initial constraints on the z = 10 LF, finding that the number density at M1500 ~= -19.7 is log (phi ) = -4.1^{+0.2}_{-0.3}, a factor of ~= 2 lower than at z = 9. Finally, we use our new results to revisit the issue of the decline in UV luminosity density (rhoUV) at z >= 8. We conclude that the data continue to support a smooth decline in rhoUV over the redshift interval 6 < z < 10, in agreement with simple models of early galaxy evolution driven by the growth in the underlying dark matter halo mass function.},

	Abstract = {We present UV luminosity functions of dropout galaxies at $z\sim6-10$ with the complete Hubble Frontier Fields data. We obtain a catalog of $\sim450$ dropout-galaxy candidates (350, 66, and 40 at $z\sim6-7$, 8, and 9, respectively), whose UV absolute magnitudes reach $\sim-14$ mag, $\sim2$ mag deeper than the Hubble Ultra Deep Field detection limits. We carefully evaluate number densities of the dropout galaxies by Monte-Carlo simulations, including all lensing effects such as magnification, distortion, and multiplication of images as well as detection completeness and contamination effects in a self-consistent manner. We find that UV luminosity functions at $z\sim6-8$ have steep faint-end slopes, $\alpha\sim-2$, and likely steeper slopes, $\alpha\lesssim-2$ at $z\sim9-10$. We also find that the evolution of UV luminosity densities shows a non-accelerated decline beyond $z\sim8$ in the case of $M_\mathrm{trunc}=-15$, while an accelerated in the case of $M_\mathrm{trunc}=-17$. We examine whether our results are consistent with the Thomson scattering optical depth from the Planck satellite and the ionized hydrogen fraction $Q_\mathrm{HII}$ at $z\lesssim7$ based on the standard analytic reionization model. We find that there exist reionizaiton scenarios that consistently explain all the observational measurements with the allowed parameters of $f_{\rm esc}=0.17^{+0.07}_{-0.03}$ and $M_\mathrm{trunc}>-14.0$ for $\log\xi_\mathrm{ion}/[\mathrm{erg}^{-1}\ \mathrm{Hz}]=25.34$, where $f_{\rm esc}$ is the escape fraction, $M_\mathrm{trunc}$ is the faint limit of the UV luminosity function, and $\xi_\mathrm{ion}$ is the conversion factor of the UV luminosity to the ionizing photon emission rate. The length of the reionization period is estimated to be $\Delta z=3.9^{+2.0}_{-1.6}$ (for $0.1<Q_\mathrm{HII}<0.99$), consistent with the recent estimate from Planck.},

	Abstract = {We use the largest sample of z˜ 6 galaxies to date from the first four Hubble Frontier Fields clusters to set constraints on the shape of the z˜ 6 luminosity functions (LFs) to fainter than {M}{UV,{AB}}=-14 mag. We quantify, for the first time, the impact of magnification uncertainties on LF results and thus provide more realistic constraints than other recent work. Our simulations reveal that, for the highly magnified sources, the systematic uncertainties can become extremely large fainter than -14 mag, reaching several orders of magnitude at 95% confidence at approximately -12 mag. Our new forward-modeling formalism incorporates the impact of magnification uncertainties into the LF results by exploiting the availability of many independent magnification models for the same cluster. One public magnification model is used to construct a mock high-redshift galaxy sample that is then analyzed using the other magnification models to construct an LF. Large systematic errors occur at high magnifications (mu ≳ 30) because of differences between the models. The volume densities we derive for faint (≳-17 mag) sources are ˜3-4× lower than one recent report and give a faint-end slope alpha =-1.92+/- 0.04, which is 3.0-3.5sigma shallower (including or not including the size uncertainties, respectively). We introduce a new curvature parameter delta to model the faint end of the LF and demonstrate that the observations permit (at 68% confidence) a turn-over at z˜ 6 in the range of -15.3 to -14.2 mag, depending on the assumed lensing model. The present consideration of magnification errors and new size determinations raise doubts about previous reports regarding the form of the LF at > -14 {mag}. We discuss the implications of our turn-over constraints in the context of recent theoretical predictions.},

	Abstract = {The ultra-deep multiwavelength Hubble Space Telescope Frontier Fields coverage of the Abell Cluster 2744 is used to derive the stellar population properties of its intracluster light (ICL). The restframe colors of the ICL of this intermediate redshift (z = 0.3064) massive cluster are bluer (g - r = 0.68 $\pm$ 0.04; i - J = 0.56 $\pm$ 0.01) than those found in the stellar populations of its main galaxy members (g - r = 0.83 $\pm$ 0.01; i - J = 0.75 $\pm$ 0.01). Based on these colors, we derive the following mean metallicity Z = 0.018 $\pm$ 0.007 for the ICL. The ICL age is 6 $\pm$ 3 Gyr younger than the average age of the most massive galaxies of the cluster. The fraction of stellar mass in the ICL component comprises at least 6% of the total stellar mass of the galaxy cluster. Our data are consistent with a scenario where the bulk of the ICL of A2744 has been formed relatively recently (z < 1). The stellar population properties of the ICL suggest that this diffuse component is mainly the result of the disruption of infalling galaxies with similar characteristics in mass (M sstarf ~ 3 × 1010 M &sun;) and metallicity than our own Milky Way. The amount of ICL mass in the central part of the cluster (<400 kpc) is equivalent to the disruption of 4-6 Milky-Way-type galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Multiwavelength deep observations are a key tool to understand the origin of the diffuse light in clusters of galaxies: the intracluster light (ICL). For this reason, we take advantage of the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) survey to investigate the properties of the stellar populations of the ICL of its six massive intermediate redshift (0.3 < z < 0.6) clusters. We carry on this analysis down to a radial distance of ˜120 kpc from the brightest cluster galaxy. We found that the average metallicity of the ICL is [Fe/H]ICL ˜ -0.5, compatible with the value of the outskirts of the Milky Way. The mean stellar ages of the ICL are between 2 and 6 Gyr younger than the most massive galaxies of the clusters. Those results suggest that the ICL of these massive (>1015 M&sun;) clusters is formed by the stripping of MW-like objects that have been accreted at z < 1, in agreement with current simulations. We do not find any significant increase in the fraction of light of the ICL with cosmic time, although the redshift range explored is narrow to derive any strong conclusion. When exploring the slope of the stellar mass density profile, we found that the ICL of the HFF clusters follows the shape of their underlying dark matter haloes, in agreement with the idea that the ICL is the result of the stripping of galaxies at recent times.},

	Abstract = {We have derived the mass distribution of galaxy cluster Abell 1689 within 0.3h-170Mpc of the cluster centre using its strong lensing (SL) effect on 32 background galaxies, which are mapped in altogether 107 multiple images. The multiple images are based on some from the literature with modifications to both include new and exclude some of the original image systems. The cluster profile is explored further out to ~2.5h-170Mpc with weak lensing (WL) shear measurements from the literature.  The masses of ~200 cluster galaxies are measured with the Fundamental Plane (FP) in order to model accurately the small-scale mass structure in the cluster. The cluster galaxies are modelled as elliptical truncated isothermal spheres. The scalings of the truncation radii with the velocity dispersions of galaxies are assumed to match those of: (i) field galaxies; and (ii) theoretical expectations for galaxies in dense environments. The dark matter (DM) component of the cluster is described by either non-singular isothermal ellipsoids (NSIE) or elliptical versions of the universal DM profile (elliptical Navarro, Frenk & White, ENFW). To account for substructure in the DM we allow for two DM haloes.  The fitting of a non-singular isothermal sphere (NSIS) to the smooth DM component results in a velocity dispersion of 1450+39-31kms-1 and a core radius of 77+10-8h-170kpc, while a Navarro, Frenk & White (NFW) profile has an r200 of 2.86 +/- 0.16h-170Mpc (M200 = 3.2 × 1015Msolarh70) and a concentration of 4.7+0.6-0.5.  The total mass profile is well described by either a NSIS profile with sigma = 1514+18-17kms-1 and a core radius of rc = 71 +/- 5h-170kpc, or an NFW profile with C = 6.0 +/- 0.5 and r200 = 2.82 +/- 0.11h-170Mpc (M200 = 3.0 × 1015Msolarh70). The errors are assumed to be due to the error in assigning masses to the individual galaxies in the galaxy component. Their small size is due to the very strong constraints imposed by multiple images and the ability of the smooth DM component to adjust to uncertainties in the galaxy masses. The agreement in the total mass profile between this work and that of the literature is better than 1sigma at all radii, despite the considerable differences in the methodology used.  Using the same image configuration as used in the literature, we obtain a SL model that is superior to some in the literature (rms of 2.7 compared to 3.2arcsec). This is very surprising considering the larger freedom in the surface mass profile in their grid modelling. The difference is most likely a result of the careful inclusion of the cluster galaxies.  Using also WL shear measurements from the literature, we can constrain the profile further out to r ~ 2.5h-170Mpc. The best-fitting parameters change to sigma = 1499 +/- 15kms-1 and rc = 66 +/- 5h-170kpc for the NSIS profile and C = 7.6 +/- 0.5 and r200 = 2.55 +/- 0.07h-170Mpc (M200 = 2.3 × 1015Msolarh70) for the NFW profile.},

	Abstract = {We precisely constrain the inner mass profile of A2261 (z = 0.225) for the first time and determine that this cluster is not "overconcentrated" as found previously, implying a formation time in agreement with LambdaCDM expectations. These results are based on multiple strong-lensing analyses of new 16-band Hubble Space Telescope imaging obtained as part of the Cluster Lensing and Supernova survey with Hubble. Combining this with revised weak-lensing analyses of Subaru wide-field imaging with five-band Subaru + KPNO photometry, we place tight new constraints on the halo virial mass M vir = (2.2 $\pm$ 0.2) × 1015 M &sun; h -1 70 (within r vir ≈ 3 Mpc h -1 70) and concentration c vir = 6.2 $\pm$ 0.3 when assuming a spherical halo. This agrees broadly with average c(M, z) predictions from recent LambdaCDM simulations, which span 5 <~ langcrang <~ 8. Our most significant systematic uncertainty is halo elongation along the line of sight (LOS). To estimate this, we also derive a mass profile based on archival Chandra X-ray observations and find it to be ~35% lower than our lensing-derived profile at r 2500 ~ 600 kpc. Agreement can be achieved by a halo elongated with a ~2:1 axis ratio along our LOS. For this elongated halo model, we find M vir = (1.7 $\pm$ 0.2) × 1015 M &sun; h -1 70 and c vir = 4.6 $\pm$ 0.2, placing rough lower limits on these values. The need for halo elongation can be partially obviated by non-thermal pressure support and, perhaps entirely, by systematic errors in the X-ray mass measurements. We estimate the effect of background structures based on MMT/Hectospec spectroscopic redshifts and find that these tend to lower M vir further by ~7% and increase c vir by ~5%.},

	Abstract = {Following Einstein's prediction of the gravitational bending of light, and in the course of experimental work aimed at its verification, only sporadic and at times misleading references have been made to Johann Georg von Soldner. In a paper published in 1804, Soldner derived the gravitational bending of light on the classical Newtonian basis and calculated its value around the sun with remarkable accuracy. Soldner's paper, inaccessible even in German, is now presented in English translation and put in the perspective of Soldner's life and the science of his day and ours.},

	Abstract = {We introduce Project MEGaSaURA: The Magellan Evolution of Galaxies Spectroscopic and Ultraviolet Reference Atlas. MEGaSaURA comprises medium-resolution, rest-frame ultraviolet spectroscopy of N=15 bright gravitationally lensed galaxies at redshifts of 1.68$<$z$<$3.6, obtained with the MagE spectrograph on the Magellan telescopes. The spectra cover the observed-frame wavelength range $3200 < \lambda_o < 8280$ \AA ; the average spectral resolving power is R=3300. The median spectrum has a signal-to-noise ratio of $SNR=21$ per resolution element at 5000 \AA . As such, the MEGaSaURA spectra have superior signal-to-noise-ratio and wavelength coverage compared to what COS/HST provides for starburst galaxies in the local universe. This paper describes the sample, the observations, and the data reduction. We compare the measured redshifts for the stars, the ionized gas as traced by nebular lines, and the neutral gas as traced by absorption lines; we find the expected bulk outflow of the neutral gas, and no systemic offset between the redshifts measured from nebular lines and the redshifts measured from the stellar continuum. We provide the MEGaSaURA spectra to the astronomical community through a data release.},

	Abstract = {We stack the rest-frame ultraviolet spectra of N = 14 highly magnified gravitationally lensed galaxies at redshifts 1.6< z< 3.6. The resulting new composite spans 900< {lambda }{rest}< 3000 {\AA}, with a peak signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 103 per spectral resolution element (~100 km s-1). It is the highest S/N, highest spectral resolution composite spectrum of z ~ 2--3 galaxies yet published. The composite reveals numerous weak nebular emission lines and stellar photospheric absorption lines that can serve as new physical diagnostics, particularly at high redshift with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We report equivalent widths to aid in proposing for and interpreting JWST spectra. We examine the velocity profiles of strong absorption features in the composite, and in a matched composite of z~ 0 COS/HST galaxy spectra. We find remarkable similarity in the velocity profiles at z~ 0 and z~ 2, suggesting that similar physical processes control the outflows across cosmic time. While the maximum outflow velocity depends strongly on ionization potential, the absorption-weighted mean velocity does not. As such, the bulk of the high-ionization absorption traces the low-ionization gas, with an additional blueshifted absorption tail extending to at least -2000 km s-1. We interpret this tail as arising from the stellar wind and photospheres of massive stars. Starburst99 models are able to replicate this high-velocity absorption tail. However, these theoretical models poorly reproduce several of the photospheric absorption features, indicating that improvements are needed to match observational constraints on the massive stellar content of star-forming galaxies at z~ 2. We publicly release our composite spectra.},

	Abstract = {Galaxy-scale strong gravitational lensing can not only provide a valuable probe of the dark matter distribution of massive galaxies, but also provide valuable cosmological constraints, either by studying the population of strong lenses or by measuring time delays in lensed quasars. Due to the rarity of galaxy-scale strongly lensed systems, fast and reliable automated lens finding methods will be essential in the era of large surveys such as Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, Euclid and Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope. To tackle this challenge, we introduce CMU DeepLens, a new fully automated galaxy-galaxy lens finding method based on deep learning. This supervised machine learning approach does not require any tuning after the training step which only requires realistic image simulations of strongly lensed systems. We train and validate our model on a set of 20 000 LSST-like mock observations including a range of lensed systems of various sizes and signal-to-noise ratios (S/N). We find on our simulated data set that for a rejection rate of non-lenses of 99 per cent, a completeness of 90 per cent can be achieved for lenses with Einstein radii larger than 1.4 arcsec and S/N larger than 20 on individual g-band LSST exposures. Finally, we emphasize the importance of realistically complex simulations for training such machine learning methods by demonstrating that the performance of models of significantly different complexities cannot be distinguished on simpler simulations. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/McWilliamsCenter/CMUDeepLens.},

	Abstract = {We report the observation and confirmation of the first group- and cluster-scale strong gravitational lensing systems found in Dark Energy Survey data. Through visual inspection of data from the Science Verification season, we identified 53 candidate systems. We then obtained spectroscopic follow-up of 21 candidates using the Gemini Multi-object Spectrograph at the Gemini South telescope and the Inamori-Magellan Areal Camera and Spectrograph at the Magellan/Baade telescope. With this follow-up, we confirmed six candidates as gravitational lenses: three of the systems are newly discovered, and the remaining three were previously known. Of the 21 observed candidates, the remaining 15 either were not detected in spectroscopic observations, were observed and did not exhibit continuum emission (or spectral features), or were ruled out as lensing systems. The confirmed sample consists of one group-scale and five galaxy-cluster-scale lenses. The lensed sources range in redshift z ˜ 0.80-3.2 and in I-band surface brightness I SB ˜ 23-25 mag arcsec-2 (2" aperture). For each of the six systems, we estimate the Einstein radius theta E and the enclosed mass M enc, which have ranges theta E ˜ 5"-9" and M enc ˜ 8 × 1012 to 6 × 1013 M &sun;, respectively.  This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.},

	Abstract = {We report the results of searches for strong gravitational lens systems in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Science Verification and Year 1 observations. The Science Verification data span approximately 250 sq. deg. with a median I-band limiting magnitude for extended objects (10sigma) of 23.0. The Year 1 data span approximately 2000 sq. deg. and have an I-band limiting magnitude for extended objects (10sigma) of 22.9. As these data sets are both wide and deep, they are particularly useful for identifying strong gravitational lens candidates. Potential strong gravitational lens candidate systems were initially identified based on a color and magnitude selection in the DES object catalogs or because the system is at the location of a previously identified galaxy cluster. Cutout images of potential candidates were then visually scanned using an object viewer and numerically ranked according to whether or not we judged them to be likely strong gravitational lens systems. Having scanned nearly 400,000 cutouts, we present 374 candidate strong lens systems, of which 348 are identified for the first time. We provide the R.A. and decl., the magnitudes and photometric properties of the lens and source objects, and the distance (radius) of the source(s) from the lens center for each system.},

@article{Thilker:2000om,
	Abstract = {We have developed a robust, automated method, hereafter designated HIIphot, which enables accurate photometric characterization of H II regions while permitting genuine adaptivity to irregular source morphology. HIIphot utilizes object recognition techniques to make a first guess at the shapes of all sources and then allows for departure from such idealized ``seeds'' through an iterative growing procedure. Photometric corrections for spatially coincident diffuse emission are derived from a low-order surface fit to the background after exclusion of all detected sources. We present results for the well-studied, nearby spiral M51 in which 1229 H II regions are detected above the 5 sigma level. A simple, weighted power-law fit to the measured Halpha luminosity function (H II LF) above logLHalpha=37.6 gives alpha=-1.75+/-0.06, despite a conspicuous break in the H II LF observed near LHalpha=1038.9. Our best-fit slope is marginally steeper than measured by Rand, perhaps reflecting our increased sensitivity at low luminosities and to notably diffuse objects. H II regions located in interarm gaps are preferentially less luminous than counterparts which constitute M51's grand design spiral arms and are best fitted with a power-law slope of alpha=-1.96+/-0.15. We assign arm/interarm status for H II regions based upon the varying surface brightness of diffuse emission as a function of position throughout the image. Using our measurement of the integrated flux contributed by resolved H II regions in M51, we estimate the diffuse fraction to be approximately 0.45-in agreement with the determination of Greenawalt et al. Automated processing of degraded narrowband data sets is undertaken in order to gauge (distance-related) systematic effects associated with limiting spatial resolution and sensitivity.},

	Abstract = {We report on five compact, extremely young (<10 Myr) and blue (betaUV < -2.5, Flambda = lambdabeta) objects observed with VLT/Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer at redshifts 3.1169 and 3.235, in addition to three objects at z = 6.145. These sources are strongly magnified (3-40 times) by the Hubble Frontier Field galaxy clusters MACS J0416 and AS1063. Their delensed half-light radii (Re) are between 16 and 140 pc, the stellar masses are ~=1-20 × 106 M&sun;, the magnitudes are mUV = 28.8-31.4 (-17 < MUV < -15) and specific star formation rates can be as large as ˜800 Gyr-1. Remarkably, the inferred physical properties of two objects are similar to those expected in some globular cluster formation scenarios, representing the best candidate proto-GCs discovered so far. Rest-frame optical high-dispersion spectroscopy of one of them at z = 3.1169 yields a velocity dispersion sigmav ~= 20 km s-1, implying a dynamical mass dominated by the stellar mass. Another object at z = 6.145, with delensed MUV ~= -15.3 (mUV ~= 31.4), shows a stellar mass and a star formation rate surface density consistent with the values expected from popular GC formation scenarios. An additional star-forming region at z = 6.145, with delensed mUV ~= 32, a stellar mass of 0.5 × 106 M&sun; and a star formation rate of 0.06 M&sun; yr-1 is also identified. These objects currently represent the faintest spectroscopically confirmed star-forming systems at z > 3, elusive even in the deepest blank fields. We discuss how proto-GCs might contribute to the ionization budget of the Universe and augment Lyalpha visibility during reionization. This work underlines the crucial role of JWST in characterizing the rest-frame optical and near-infrared properties of such low-luminosity high-z objects.},

	Abstract = {We study the spectrophotometric properties of a highly magnified (mu ~= 40{--}70) pair of stellar systems identified at z = 3.2222 behind the Hubble Frontier Field galaxy cluster MACS J0416. Five multiple images (out of six) have been spectroscopically confirmed by means of VLT/MUSE and VLT/X-Shooter observations. Each image includes two faint ({m}{UV}~= 30.6), young (≲ 100 Myr), low-mass (< {10}7 {M}&sun; ), low-metallicity (12 + Log(O/H) ~= 7.7, or 1/10 solar), and compact (30 pc effective radius) stellar systems separated by ~= 300 pc after correcting for lensing amplification. We measured several rest-frame ultraviolet and optical narrow ({sigma }v≲ 25 km s-1) high-ionization lines. These features may be the signature of very hot (T> {{50,000}} K) stars within dense stellar clusters, whose dynamical mass is likely dominated by the stellar component. Remarkably, the ultraviolet metal lines are not accompanied by Lyalpha emission (e.g., C IV/Lyalpha >  15), despite the fact that the Lyalpha line flux is expected to be 150 times brighter (inferred from the Hbeta flux). A spatially offset, strongly magnified (mu > 50) Lyalpha emission with a spatial extent ≲ 7.6 kpc2 is instead identified 2 kpc away from the system. The origin of such a faint emission could be the result of fluorescent Lyalpha induced by a transverse leakage of ionizing radiation emerging from the stellar systems and/or may be associated with an underlying and barely detected object (with {m}{UV}> 34 de-lensed). This is the first confirmed metal-line emitter at such low-luminosity and redshift without Lyalpha emission---suggesting that, at least in some cases, a non-uniform covering factor of the neutral gas might hamper the Lyalpha detection.  Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory for Astronomical research in the southern hemisphere, under ESO programmes P095.A-0840, P095.A-0653, and P186.A-0798.},

	Abstract = {Cosmological surface brightness (SB) dimming of the form (1 + z)-4 affects all sources. The strong dependence of SB dimming on redshift z suggests the presence of a selection bias when searching for high-z galaxies, i.e., we tend to detect only those galaxies with a high SB. However, unresolved knots of emission are not affected by SB dimming, thus providing a way to test the clumpiness of high-z galaxies. Our strategy relies on the comparison of the total flux detected for the same source in surveys characterized by different depth. For all galaxies, deeper images permit the better investigation of low-SB features. Cosmological SB dimming makes these low-SB features hard to detect when going to higher and higher redshifts. We used the GOODS and HUDF Hubble Space Telescope legacy data sets to study the effect of SB dimming on low-SB features of high-z galaxies and compare it to the prediction for smooth sources. We selected a sample of Lyman-break galaxies at z ~ 4 (i.e., B 435-band dropouts) detected in all of the data sets and found no significant trend when comparing the total magnitudes measured from images with different depth. Through Monte Carlo simulations we derived the expected trend for galaxies with different SB profiles. The comparison to the data hints at a compact distribution for most of the rest-frame ultraviolet light emitted from high-z galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We present ˜100 pc resolution Hubble Space Telescope Halpha images of 10 galaxies from the DYnamics of Newly-Assembled Massive Objects (DYNAMO) survey of low-z turbulent disc galaxies, and use these to undertake the first detailed systematic study of the effects of resolution and clump clustering on observations of clumps in turbulent discs. In the DYNAMO-HST sample, we measure clump diameters spanning the range dclump ˜ 100-800 pc, and individual clump star formation rates as high as ˜5 M&sun; yr-1. DYNAMO clumps have very high SFR surface densities, SigmaSFR ˜ 1 - 15 M&sun; yr-1 kpc-2, ˜100 × higher than in H II regions of nearby spirals. Indeed, SFR surface density provides a simple dividing line between massive star-forming clumps and local star-forming regions, where massive star-forming clumps have SigmaSFR > 0.5 M&sun; yr-1 kpc-2. When degraded to match the observations of galaxies in z ˜ 1-3 surveys, DYNAMO galaxies are similar in morphology and measured clump properties to clumpy galaxies observed in the high-z Universe. Emission peaks in the simulated high-redshift maps typically correspond to multiple clumps in full resolution images. This clustering of clumps systematically increases the apparent size and SFR of clumps in 1 kpc resolution maps, and decreases the measured SFR surface density of clumps by as much as a factor of 20×. From these results we can infer that clump clustering is likely to strongly affect the measured properties of clumps in high-z galaxies, which commonly have kiloparsec scale resolution.},

	Abstract = {The SIRTF Nearby Galaxy Survey is a comprehensive infrared imaging and spectroscopic survey of 75 nearby galaxies. Its primary goal is to characterize the infrared emission of galaxies and their principal infrared-emitting components, across a broad range of galaxy properties and star formation environments. SINGS will provide new insights into the physical processes connecting star formation to the interstellar medium properties of galaxies and provide a vital foundation for understanding infrared observations of the distant universe and ultraluminous and active galaxies. The galaxy sample and observing strategy have been designed to maximize the scientific and archival value of the data set for the SIRTF user community at large. The SIRTF images and spectra will be supplemented by a comprehensive multiwavelength library of ancillary and complementary observations, including radio continuum, H I, CO, submillimeter, BVRIJHK, Halpha, Paalpha, ultraviolet, and X-ray data. This paper describes the main astrophysical issues to be addressed by SINGS, the galaxy sample and the observing strategy, and the SIRTF and other ancillary data products.},

	Abstract = {We present a detailed study of the spatially resolved kinematics, star formation and stellar mass in a highly amplified galaxy at z = 4.92 behind the lensing cluster MS1358+62. We use the observed optical, near- and mid-infrared imaging from Hubble Space Telescope ACS & NICMOS and Spitzer IRAC to derive the stellar mass and the Gemini/NIFS IFU to investigate the velocity structure of the galaxy from the nebular [OII]lambdalambda3726.8,3728.9 emission. Using a detailed gravitational lens model, we account for lensing amplification factor 12.5 +/- 2.0 and find that this intrinsically L* galaxy has a stellar mass of M* = 7 +/- 2 × 108Msolar, a dynamical mass of Mdyn = 3 +/- 1 × 109csc2(i)Msolar (within of 2kpc) and a star formation rate of 42 +/- 8Msolaryr-1. The source-plane UV/optical morphology of this galaxy is dominated by five discrete star-forming regions. Exploiting the dynamical information we derive masses for individual star-forming regions of Mcl ~ 108-9Msolar with sizes of ~200pc. We find that, at a fixed size, the star formation rate density within these HII regions is approximately two orders of magnitude greater than those observed in local spiral/starburst galaxies, but consistent with the most massive HII regions in the local Universe such as 30Doradus. Finally, we compare the spatially resolved nebular emission-line velocity with the Lyalpha and UV interstellar medium (ISM) lines and find that this galaxy is surrounded by a galactic scale outflow in which the Lyalpha appears redshifted by ~150kms-1 and the UV-ISM lines blueshifted by ~ -200kms-1 from the (systemic) nebular emission. The velocity structure of the outflow mirrors that of the nebular emission suggesting the outflow is young (<~15Myr), and has yet to burst out of the system. Taken together, these results suggest that this young galaxy is undergoing its first major epoch of mass assembly.},

	Abstract = {We exploit the gravitational potential of a massive, rich cluster at z = 0.77 to study the internal properties of a gravitationally lensed galaxy at z = 4.88. Using high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope imaging together with optical (VIMOS) and near-infrared (SINFONI) integral field spectroscopy, we have studied the rest-frame ultraviolet and optical properties of the lensed galaxy seen through the cluster RCS0224-002. Using a detailed gravitational lens model of the cluster, we reconstruct the source-frame morphology on 200 pc scales and find an ~L* Lyman-break galaxy with an intrinsic size of only 2.0 × 0.8 kpc, a velocity gradient of <~60kms-1 and an implied dynamical mass of 1.0 × 1010Msolar within 2 kpc. We infer an integrated star formation rate of just 12 +/- 2Msolaryr-1 from the intrinsic [OII]lambda3727 emission-line flux. The Lyalpha emission appears redshifted by +200 +/- 40kms-1 with respect to the [OII] emission. The Lyalpha is also significantly more extended than the nebular emission, extending over 11.9 × 2.4 kpc. Over this area, the Lyalpha centroid varies by less than 10kms-1. We model the asymmetric Lyalpha emission with an underlying Gaussian profile with an absorber in the blue wing and find that the underlying Lyalpha emission-line centroid is in excellent agreement with the [OII] emission-line redshift. By examining the spatially resolved structure of the [OII] and Lyalpha emission lines, we investigate the nature of this system. The model for local starburst galaxies suggested by Mas-Hesse et al. provides a good description of our data, and suggests that the galaxy is surrounded by a galactic-scale bipolar outflow which has recently bursted out of the system. The outflow, which appears to be currently located >~30 kpc from the galaxy, is escaping at a speed of upto ~500kms-1. Although the mass of the outflow is uncertain, the geometry and velocity of the outflow suggests that the ejected material is travelling far faster than escape velocity and will travel more than 1 Mpc (comoving) before eventually stalling.},

Star formation in the disks and nuclear regions of galaxies are reviewed separately, then discussed within a common interpretive framework.

	Abstract = {We examine the connection between the observed star-forming sequence (SFR vprop M alpha) and the observed evolution of the stellar mass function in the range 0.2 < z < 2.5. We find that the star-forming sequence cannot have a slope alpha <~ 0.9 at all masses and redshifts because this would result in a much higher number density at 10 < log (M/M &sun;) < 11 by z = 1 than is observed. We show that a transition in the slope of the star-forming sequence, such that alpha = 1 at log (M/M &sun;) < 10.5 and alpha = 0.7-0.13z (Whitaker et al.) at log (M/M &sun;) > 10.5, greatly improves agreement with the evolution of the stellar mass function. We then derive a star-forming sequence that reproduces the evolution of the mass function by design. This star-forming sequence is also well described by a broken power law, with a shallow slope at high masses and a steep slope at low masses. At z = 2, it is offset by ~0.3 dex from the observed star-forming sequence, consistent with the mild disagreement between the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) and recent observations of the growth of the stellar mass density. It is unclear whether this problem stems from errors in stellar mass estimates, errors in SFRs, or other effects. We show that a mass-dependent slope is also seen in other self-consistent models of galaxy evolution, including semianalytical, hydrodynamical, and abundance-matching models. As part of the analysis, we demonstrate that neither mergers nor hidden low-mass quiescent galaxies are likely to reconcile the evolution of the mass function and the star-forming sequence. These results are supported by observations from Whitaker et al.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the evolution of clumpy galaxies with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) samples of ˜17,000 photo-z and Lyman break galaxies at z ~= 0-8. We detect clumpy galaxies with off-center clumps in a self-consistent algorithm that is well tested with previous study results, and we measure the number fraction of clumpy galaxies at the rest-frame UV, {f}{{clumpy}}{{UV}}. We identify an evolutionary trend of {f}{{clumpy}}{{UV}} over z ~= 0-8 for the first time: {f}{{clumpy}}{{UV}} increases from z ~= 8 to z ~= 1-3 and subsequently decreases from z ~= 1 to z ~= 0, which follows the trend of the Madau-Lilly plot. A low average S{\'e}rsic index of n ~= 1 is found in the underlining components of our clumpy galaxies at z ~= 0-2, indicating that typical clumpy galaxies have disk-like surface brightness profiles. Our {f}{{clumpy}}{{UV}} values correlate with physical quantities related to star formation activities for star-forming galaxies at z ~= 0-7. We find that clump colors tend to be red at a small galactocentric distance for massive galaxies with {log}{M}*/{M}&sun;  ≳  11. All of these results are consistent with the picture that a majority of clumps form in the violent disk instability and migrate into the galactic centers.},

@article{Noguchi:1999vf,
	Abstract = {A new idea is proposed for the origin of bulges in spiral galaxies. Numerical simulations of protogalactic collapse suggest strongly that galactic bulges have been assembled from massive clumps formed in galactic disks in their early evolutionary phase. These clumps result from the gravitational instability of the gas-rich disks of young galaxies. Owing to dynamical frictions, those massive clumps, individual masses of which can be as large as ~109 Msolar, are able to spiral toward the galactic center within a few Gyr. Inward transport of disk matter by this process leads to the formation of a galactic bulge. A simple analytical model has been constructed in which the clumpy evolution of a disk galaxy is controlled by two parameters: the timescale with which the primordial gas in the halo accretes onto the disk plane (i.e., the collapse timescale) and the initial mass fraction of the gas relative to the galaxy total mass. Under plausible assumptions for the variation of these parameters among spiral galaxies, the clumpy evolution model can explain an observed trend in which the bulge-to-disk ratio increases as the total mass or the internal density of the galaxy increases. This success suggests that the clumpy evolution of the galactic disk constitutes an important ingredient of disk galaxy evolution. Star formation in primeval disk galaxies takes place mostly in the clumps. The resulting knotty appearance of these systems may explain the peculiar morphology observed in a number of high-redshift galaxies.},

	Abstract = {What are the faintest distant galaxies we can see with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) now, before the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope? This is the challenge taken up by the Frontier Fields, a Director's discretionary time campaign with HST and the Spitzer Space Telescope to see deeper into the universe than ever before. The Frontier Fields combines the power of HST and Spitzer with the natural gravitational telescopes of massive high-magnification clusters of galaxies to produce the deepest observations of clusters and their lensed galaxies ever obtained. Six clusters---Abell 2744, MACSJ0416.1-2403, MACSJ0717.5+3745, MACSJ1149.5+2223, Abell S1063, and Abell 370---have been targeted by the HST ACS/WFC and WFC3/IR cameras with coordinated parallel fields for over 840 HST orbits. The parallel fields are the second-deepest observations thus far by HST with 5sigma point-source depths of ˜29th ABmag. Galaxies behind the clusters experience typical magnification factors of a few, with small regions magnified by factors of 10-100. Therefore, the Frontier Field cluster HST images achieve intrinsic depths of ˜30-33 mag over very small volumes. Spitzer has obtained over 1000 hr of Director's discretionary imaging of the Frontier Field cluster and parallels in IRAC 3.6 and 4.5 mum bands to 5sigma point-source depths of ˜26.5, 26.0 ABmag. We demonstrate the exceptional sensitivity of the HST Frontier Field images to faint high-redshift galaxies, and review the initial results related to the primary science goals.},

@article{von-der-Linden:2014wd,
	Abstract = {This is the first in a series of papers in which we measure accurate weak-lensing masses for 51 of the most X-ray luminous galaxy clusters known at redshifts 0.15 ≲ zCl ≲ 0.7, in order to calibrate X-ray and other mass proxies for cosmological cluster experiments. The primary aim is to improve the absolute mass calibration of cluster observables, currently the dominant systematic uncertainty for cluster count experiments. Key elements of this work are the rigorous quantification of systematic uncertainties, high-quality data reduction and photometric calibration, and the `blind' nature of the analysis to avoid confirmation bias. Our target clusters are drawn from X-ray catalogues based on the ROSAT All-Sky Survey, and provide a versatile calibration sample for many aspects of cluster cosmology. We have acquired wide-field, high-quality imaging using the Subaru Telescope and Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope for all 51 clusters, in at least three bands per cluster. For a subset of 27 clusters, we have data in at least five bands, allowing accurate photometric redshift estimates of lensed galaxies. In this paper, we describe the cluster sample and observations, and detail the processing of the SuprimeCam data to yield high-quality images suitable for robust weak-lensing shape measurements and precision photometry. For each cluster, we present wide-field three-colour optical images and maps of the weak-lensing mass distribution, the optical light distribution and the X-ray emission. These provide insights into the large-scale structure in which the clusters are embedded. We measure the offsets between X-ray flux centroids and the brightest cluster galaxies in the clusters, finding these to be small in general, with a median of 20 kpc. For offsets ≲100 kpc, weak-lensing mass measurements centred on the brightest cluster galaxies agree well with values determined relative to the X-ray centroids; miscentring is therefore not a significant source of systematic uncertainty for our weak-lensing mass measurements. In accompanying papers, we discuss the key aspects of our photometric calibration and photometric redshift measurements (Kelly et al.), and measure cluster masses using two methods, including a novel Bayesian weak-lensing approach that makes full use of the photometric redshift probability distributions for individual background galaxies (Applegate et al.). In subsequent papers, we will incorporate these weak-lensing mass measurements into a self-consistent framework to simultaneously determine cluster scaling relations and cosmological parameters.},

	Abstract = {We present a catalog of 68 galaxy clusters, of which 19 are new discoveries, detected via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZ) at 148 GHz in the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) survey on the celestial equator. With this addition, the ACT collaboration has reported a total of 91 optically confirmed, SZ detected clusters. The 504 square degree survey region includes 270 square degrees of overlap with SDSS Stripe 82, permitting the confirmation of SZ cluster candidates in deep archival optical data. The subsample of 48 clusters within Stripe 82 is estimated to be 90% complete for M500c > 4.5 × 1014Msolar and redshifts 0.15 < z < 0.8. While a full suite of matched filters is used to detect the clusters, the sample is studied further through a ''Profile Based Amplitude Analysis'' using a statistic derived from a single filter at a fixed theta500 = 5farcm9 angular scale. This new approach incorporates the cluster redshift along with prior information on the cluster pressure profile to fix the relationship between the cluster characteristic size (R500) and the integrated Compton parameter (Y500). We adopt a one-parameter family of ''Universal Pressure Profiles'' (UPP) with associated scaling laws, derived from X-ray measurements of nearby clusters, as a baseline model. Three additional models of cluster physics are used to investigate a range of scaling relations beyond the UPP prescription. Assuming a concordance cosmology, the UPP scalings are found to be nearly identical to an adiabatic model, while a model incorporating non-thermal pressure better matches dynamical mass measurements and masses from the South Pole Telescope. A high signal to noise ratio subsample of 15 ACT clusters with complete optical follow-up is used to obtain cosmological constraints. We demonstrate, using fixed scaling relations, how the constraints depend on the assumed gas model if only SZ measurements are used, and show that constraints from SZ data are limited by uncertainty in the scaling relation parameters rather than sample size or measurement uncertainty. We next add in seven clusters from the ACT Southern survey, including their dynamical mass measurements, which are based on galaxy velocity dispersions and thus are independent of the gas physics. In combination with WMAP7 these data simultaneously constrain the scaling relation and cosmological parameters, yielding 68% confidence ranges described by sigma8 = 0.829 $\pm$ 0.024 and Omegam = 0.292 $\pm$ 0.025.. We consider these results in the context of constraints from CMB and other cluster studies. The constraints arise mainly due to the inclusion of the dynamical mass information and do not require strong priors on the SZ scaling relation parameters. The results include marginalization over a 15% bias in dynamical masses relative to the true halo mass. In an extension to LambdaCDM that incorporates non-zero neutrino mass density, we combine our data with WMAP7, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data, and Hubble constant measurements to constrain the sum of the neutrino mass species to be ∑numnu < 0.29 eV (95% confidence limit).},

	Abstract = {We report on 23 clusters detected blindly as Sunyaev-ZEL'DOVICH (SZ) decrements in a 148 GHz, 455 deg2 map of the southern sky made with data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope 2008 observing season. All SZ detections announced in this work have confirmed optical counterparts. Ten of the clusters are new discoveries. One newly discovered cluster, ACT-CL J0102-4915, with a redshift of 0.75 (photometric), has an SZ decrement comparable to the most massive systems at lower redshifts. Simulations of the cluster recovery method reproduce the sample purity measured by optical follow-up. In particular, for clusters detected with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than six, simulations are consistent with optical follow-up that demonstrated this subsample is 100% pure. The simulations further imply that the total sample is 80% complete for clusters with mass in excess of 6 × 1014 solar masses referenced to the cluster volume characterized by 500 times the critical density. The Compton y-X-ray luminosity mass comparison for the 11 best-detected clusters visually agrees with both self-similar and non-adiabatic, simulation-derived scaling laws.},

@article{Menanteau:2012ul,
	Abstract = {We present a detailed analysis from new multi-wavelength observations of the exceptional galaxy cluster ACT-CL J0102-4915, likely the most massive, hottest, most X-ray luminous and brightest Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect cluster known at redshifts greater than 0.6. The Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) collaboration discovered ACT-CL J0102-4915 as the most significant SZ decrement in a sky survey area of 755 deg2. Our Very Large Telescope (VLT)/FORS2 spectra of 89 member galaxies yield a cluster redshift, z = 0.870, and velocity dispersion, sigmagal = 1321 $\pm$ 106 km s-1. Our Chandra observations reveal a hot and X-ray luminous system with an integrated temperature of T X = 14.5 $\pm$ 0.1 keV and 0.5-2.0 keV band luminosity of L X = (2.19 $\pm$ 0.11) × 1045 h -2 70 erg s-1. We obtain several statistically consistent cluster mass estimates; using empirical mass scaling relations with velocity dispersion, X-ray Y X, and integrated SZ distortion, we estimate a cluster mass of M 200a  = (2.16 $\pm$ 0.32) × 1015 h -1 70 M &sun;. We constrain the stellar content of the cluster to be less than 1% of the total mass, using Spitzer IRAC and optical imaging. The Chandra and VLT/FORS2 optical data also reveal that ACT-CL J0102-4915 is undergoing a major merger between components with a mass ratio of approximately 2 to 1. The X-ray data show significant temperature variations from a low of 6.6 $\pm$ 0.7 keV at the merging low-entropy, high-metallicity, cool core to a high of 22 $\pm$ 6 keV. We also see a wake in the X-ray surface brightness and deprojected gas density caused by the passage of one cluster through the other. Archival radio data at 843 MHz reveal diffuse radio emission that, if associated with the cluster, indicates the presence of an intense double radio relic, hosted by the highest redshift cluster yet. ACT-CL J0102-4915 is possibly a high-redshift analog of the famous Bullet cluster. Such a massive cluster at this redshift is rare, although consistent with the standard LambdaCDM cosmology in the lower part of its allowed mass range. Massive, high-redshift mergers like ACT-CL J0102-4915 are unlikely to be reproduced in the current generation of numerical N-body cosmological simulations.},

	Abstract = {We present optical and X-ray properties for the first confirmed galaxy cluster sample selected by the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) from 148 GHz maps over 455 deg2 of sky made with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). These maps, coupled with multi-band imaging on 4 m class optical telescopes, have yielded a sample of 23 galaxy clusters with redshifts between 0.118 and 1.066. Of these 23 clusters, 10 are newly discovered. The selection of this sample is approximately mass limited and essentially independent of redshift. We provide optical positions, images, redshifts, and X-ray fluxes and luminosities for the full sample, and X-ray temperatures of an important subset. The mass limit of the full sample is around 8.0 × 1014 M sun, with a number distribution that peaks around a redshift of 0.4. For the 10 highest significance SZE-selected cluster candidates, all of which are optically confirmed, the mass threshold is 1 × 1015 M sun and the redshift range is 0.167-1.066. Archival observations from Chandra, XMM-Newton, and ROSAT provide X-ray luminosities and temperatures that are broadly consistent with this mass threshold. Our optical follow-up procedure also allowed us to assess the purity of the ACT cluster sample. Eighty (one hundred) percent of the 148 GHz candidates with signal-to-noise ratios greater than 5.1 (5.7) are confirmed as massive clusters. The reported sample represents one of the largest SZE-selected sample of massive clusters over all redshifts within a cosmologically significant survey volume, which will enable cosmological studies as well as future studies on the evolution, morphology, and stellar populations in the most massive clusters in the universe.},

It contains 861 confirmed clusters, of which 178 have been confirmed as clusters, mostly through follow-up observations, and a further 683 are previously-known clusters. The remaining 366 have the status of cluster candidates, and we divide them into three classes according to the quality of evidence that they are likely to be true clusters. The Planck SZ catalogue is the deepest all-sky cluster catalogue, with redshifts up to about one, and spans the broadest cluster mass range from (0.1 to 1.6) × 1015 M&sun;. Confirmation of cluster candidates through comparison with existing surveys or cluster catalogues is extensively described, as is the statistical characterization of the catalogue in terms of completeness and statistical reliability. The outputs of the validation process are provided as additional information. This gives, in particular, an ensemble of 813 cluster redshifts, and for all these Planck clusters we also include a mass estimated from a newly-proposed SZ-mass proxy. A refined measure of the SZ Compton parameter for the clusters with X-ray counter-parts is provided, as is an X-ray flux for all the Planck clusters not previously detected in X-ray surveys.  The catalogue of SZ sources is available at Planck Legacy Archive and http://www.sciops.esa.int/index.php?page=Planck_Legacy_Archive&project=planck},

	Abstract = {We describe redMaPPer, a new red sequence cluster finder specifically designed to make optimal use of ongoing and near-future large photometric surveys. The algorithm has multiple attractive features: (1) it can iteratively self-train the red sequence model based on a minimal spectroscopic training sample, an important feature for high-redshift surveys. (2) It can handle complex masks with varying depth. (3) It produces cluster-appropriate random points to enable large-scale structure studies. (4) All clusters are assigned a full redshift probability distribution P(z). (5) Similarly, clusters can have multiple candidate central galaxies, each with corresponding centering probabilities. (6) The algorithm is parallel and numerically efficient: it can run a Dark Energy Survey-like catalog in ~500 CPU hours. (7) The algorithm exhibits excellent photometric redshift performance, the richness estimates are tightly correlated with external mass proxies, and the completeness and purity of the corresponding catalogs are superb. We apply the redMaPPer algorithm to ~10, 000 deg2 of SDSS DR8 data and present the resulting catalog of ~25,000 clusters over the redshift range z in [0.08, 0.55]. The redMaPPer photometric redshifts are nearly Gaussian, with a scatter sigma z  ≈ 0.006 at z ≈ 0.1, increasing to sigma z  ≈ 0.02 at z ≈ 0.5 due to increased photometric noise near the survey limit. The median value for |Deltaz|/(1 + z) for the full sample is 0.006. The incidence of projection effects is low (<=5%). Detailed performance comparisons of the redMaPPer DR8 cluster catalog to X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich catalogs are presented in a companion paper.},

@article{Horner:1999rz,
	Abstract = {We examine the relationship between the mass and X-ray gas temperature of galaxy clusters using data drawn from the literature. Simple theoretical arguments suggest that the mass of a cluster is related to the X-ray temperature as M~T3/2X. Virial theorem mass estimates based on cluster galaxy velocity dispersions seem to be accurately described by this scaling with a normalization consistent with that predicted by the simulations of Evrard, Metzler, and Navarro. X-ray mass estimates that employ spatially resolved temperature profiles also follow a T3/2X scaling although with a normalization about 40% lower than that of the fit to the virial masses. However, the isothermal beta-model and X-ray surface brightness deprojection masses follow a steeper ~T1.8-2.0X scaling. The steepness of the isothermal estimates is due to their implicitly assumed dark matter density profile of rho(r)~r-2 at large radii, whereas observations and simulations suggest that clusters follow steeper profiles [e.g., rho(r)~r-2.4].},

@article{Benitez:2000uq,
	Abstract = {Photometric redshifts are quickly becoming an essential tool of observational cosmology, although their utilization is somewhat hindered by certain shortcomings of the existing methods, e.g., the unreliability of maximum-likelihood techniques or the limited application range of the ``training-set'' approach. The application of Bayesian inference to the problem of photometric redshift estimation effectively overcomes most of these problems. The use of prior probabilities and Bayesian marginalization facilitates the inclusion of relevant knowledge, such as the expected shape of the redshift distributions and the galaxy type fractions, which can be readily obtained from existing surveys but are often ignored by other methods. If this previous information is lacking or insufficient-for instance, because of the unprecedented depth of the observations-the corresponding prior distributions can be calibrated using even the data sample for which the photometric redshifts are being obtained. An important advantage of Bayesian statistics is that the accuracy of the redshift estimation can be characterized in a way that has no equivalents in other statistical approaches, enabling the selection of galaxy samples with extremely reliable photometric redshifts. In this way, it is possible to determine the properties of individual galaxies more accurately, and simultaneously estimate the statistical properties of a sample in an optimal fashion. Moreover, the Bayesian formalism described here can be easily generalized to deal with a wide range of problems that make use of photometric redshifts. There is excellent agreement between the ~130 Hubble Deep Field North (HDF-N) spectroscopic redshifts and the predictions of the method, with a rms error of Deltaz~0.06(1+zspec) up to z<6 and no outliers nor systematic biases. It should be remarked that since these results have not been reached following a training-set procedure, the above value of Deltaz should be a fair estimate of the expected accuracy for any similar sample. The method is further tested by estimating redshifts in the HDF-N but restricting the color information to the UBVI filters; the results are shown to be significantly more reliable than those obtained with maximum-likelihood techniques.},

	Abstract = {The authors present the latest data collected in November 1986 on the very blue giant ring-like structure recently discovered in the center of the cluster Abell 370 (z = 0.374). The spectrum of the eastern end of the structure is analyzed in details: it does not show any of the strong emission lines characterizing a QSO, and all the typical features expected in a gas or in a galaxy at the cluster redshift are missing. Such a result seems to rule out several models involving in-situ star formation. Moreover, the large scale spectral energy distribution looks like the continuum of a spiral galaxy redshifted to z = 0.59. So, the interpretation in terms of gravitational lensing is proposed. The results of a multipoint mass model allows one to reconstruct the entire ring-like structure. However, some properties remain difficult to understand.},

	Abstract = {Using the combined resolving power of the Hubble Space Telescope and gravitational lensing, we resolve star-forming structures in a z~ 2.5 galaxy on scales much smaller than the usual kiloparsec diffraction limit of HST. SGAS J111020.0+645950.8 is a clumpy, star-forming galaxy lensed by the galaxy cluster SDSS J1110+6459 at z=0.659, with a total magnification ~ 30×  across the entire arc. We use a hybrid parametric/non-parametric strong lensing mass model to compute the deflection and magnification of this giant arc, reconstruct the light distribution of the lensed galaxy in the source plane, and resolve the star formation into two dozen clumps. We develop a forward-modeling technique to model each clump in the source plane. We ray-trace the model to the image plane, convolve with the instrumental point-spread function (PSF), and compare with the GALFIT model of the clumps in the image plane, which decomposes clump structure from more extended emission. This technique has the advantage, over ray-tracing, of accounting for the asymmetric lensing shear of the galaxy in the image plane and the instrument PSF. At this resolution, we can begin to study star formation on a clump-by-clump basis, toward the goal of understanding feedback mechanisms and the buildup of exponential disks at high redshift.  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.

	Abstract = {We present measurements of the surface density of star formation, the star-forming clump luminosity function, and the clump size distribution function, for the lensed galaxy SGAS J111020.0+645950.8 at a redshift of z = 2.481. The physical size scales that we probe, radii r = 30--50 pc, are considerably smaller scales than have yet been studied at these redshifts. The star formation surface density we find within these small clumps is consistent with surface densities measured previously for other lensed galaxies at similar redshift. Twenty-two percent of the rest-frame ultraviolet light in this lensed galaxy arises from small clumps, with r< 100 pc. Within the range of overlap, the clump luminosity function measured for this lensed galaxy is remarkably similar to those of z~ 0 galaxies. In this galaxy, star-forming regions smaller than 100 pc---physical scales not usually resolved at these redshifts by current telescopes---are important locations of star formation in the distant universe. If this galaxy is representative, this may contradict the theoretical picture in which the critical size scale for star formation in the distant universe is of the order of 1 kpc. Instead, our results suggest that current telescopes have not yet resolved the critical size scales of star-forming activity in galaxies over most of cosmic time.

	Abstract = {For lensed galaxy SGAS J111020.0+645950.8 at redshift z = 2.481, which is magnified by a factor of 28 $\pm$ 8, we analyze the morphology of star formation, as traced by rest-frame ultraviolet emission, in both the highly magnified source plane and simulations of how this galaxy would appear without lensing magnification. Were this galaxy not lensed, but rather drawn from a Hubble Space Telescope deep field, we would conclude that almost all its star formation arises from an exponential disk (S{\'e}rsic index of 1.0 $\pm$ 0.4) with an effective radius of {r}e=2.7+/- 0.3 {kpc} measured from two-dimensional fitting to F606W using Galfit, and {r}e=1.9+/- 0.1 {kpc} measured by fitting a radial profile to F606W elliptical isophotes. At the normal spatial resolution of the deep fields, there is no sign of clumpy star formation within SGAS J111020.0+645950.8. However, the enhanced spatial resolution enabled by gravitational lensing tells a very different story; much of the star formation arises in two dozen clumps with sizes of r = 30--50 pc spread across the 7 kpc length of the galaxy. The color and spatial distribution of the diffuse component suggests that still-smaller clumps are unresolved. Despite this clumpy, messy morphology, the radial profile is still well-characterized by an exponential profile. In this lensed galaxy, stars are forming in complexes with sizes well below 100 pc such sizes are wholly unexplored by surveys of galaxy evolution at 1< z< 3.},

@article{Florian:2016fk,
	Abstract = {Characterization of the morphology of strongly lensed galaxies is challenging because images of such galaxies are typically highly distorted. Lens modeling and source plane reconstruction is one approach that can provide reasonably undistorted images from which morphological measurements can be made, though at the expense of a highly spatially variable telescope point-spread function (PSF) when mapped back to the source plane. Unfortunately, modeling the lensing mass is a time- and resource-intensive process, and in many cases there are too few constraints to precisely model the lensing mass. If, however, useful morphological measurements could be made in the image plane rather than the source plane, it would bypass this issue and obviate the need for a source reconstruction process for some applications. We examine the use of the Gini coefficient as one such measurement. Because it depends on the cumulative distribution of the light of a galaxy, but not the relative spatial positions, the fact that surface brightness is conserved by lensing means that the Gini coefficient may be well preserved by strong gravitational lensing. Through simulations, we test the extent to which the Gini coefficient is conserved, including by effects due to PSF convolution and pixelization, to determine whether it is invariant enough under lensing to be used as a measurement of galaxy morphology that can be made in the image plane.},

	Abstract = {The sample of cosmological strong lensing systems has been steadily growing in recent years and with the advent of the next generation of space-based survey telescopes, the sample will reach into the thousands. The accuracy of strong lens models relies on robust identification of multiple image families of lensed galaxies. For the most massive lenses, often more than one background galaxy is magnified and multiply imaged, and even in the cases of only a single lensed source, identification of counter images is not always robust. Recently, we have shown that the Gini coefficient in space-telescope-quality imaging is a measurement of galaxy morphology that is relatively well-preserved by strong gravitational lensing. Here, we investigate its usefulness as a diagnostic for the purposes of image family identification and show that it can remove some of the degeneracies encountered when using color as the sole diagnostic, and can do so without the need for additional observations since whenever a color is available, two Gini coefficients are as well.},

	Abstract = {We study the abundance of substructure in the matter density near galaxies using ALMA Science Verification observations of the strong lensing system SDP.81. We present a method to measure the abundance of subhalos around galaxies using interferometric observations of gravitational lenses. Using simulated ALMA observations we explore the effects of various systematics, including antenna phase errors and source priors, and show how such errors may be measured or marginalized. We apply our formalism to ALMA observations of SDP.81. We find evidence for the presence of a M = 108.96$\pm$0.12 M &sun; subhalo near one of the images, with a significance of 6.9sigma in a joint fit to data from bands 6 and 7; the effect of the subhalo is also detected in both bands individually. We also derive constraints on the abundance of dark matter (DM) subhalos down to M ˜ 2 × 107 M &sun;, pushing down to the mass regime of the smallest detected satellites in the Local Group, where there are significant discrepancies between the observed population of luminous galaxies and predicted DM subhalos. We find hints of additional substructure, warranting further study using the full SDP.81 data set (including, for example, the spectroscopic imaging of the lensed carbon monoxide emission). We compare the results of this search to the predictions of LambdaCDM halos, and find that given current uncertainties in the host halo properties of SDP.81, our measurements of substructure are consistent with theoretical expectations. Observations of larger samples of gravitational lenses with ALMA should be able to improve the constraints on the abundance of galactic substructure.},

	Abstract = {The South Pole Telescope has discovered 100 gravitationally lensed, high-redshift, dusty, star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). We present 0."5 resolution 870 mu {{m}} Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array imaging of a sample of 47 DSFGs spanning z=1.9{--}5.7, and construct gravitational lens models of these sources. Our visibility-based lens modeling incorporates several sources of residual interferometric calibration uncertainty, allowing us to properly account for noise in the observations. At least 70% of the sources are strongly lensed by foreground galaxies ({mu }870mu {{m}}\gt 2), with a median magnification of {mu }870mu {{m}}=6.3, extending to {mu }870mu {{m}}\gt 30. We compare the intrinsic size distribution of the strongly lensed sources to a similar number of unlensed DSFGs and find no significant differences in spite of a bias between the magnification and intrinsic source size. This may indicate that the true size distribution of DSFGs is relatively narrow. We use the source sizes to constrain the wavelength at which the dust optical depth is unity and find this wavelength to be correlated with the dust temperature. This correlation leads to discrepancies in dust mass estimates of a factor of two compared to estimates using a single value for this wavelength. We investigate the relationship between the [C ii] line and the far-infrared luminosity and find that the same correlation between the [C ii]/{L}{{FIR}} ratio and {{{Sigma }}}{{FIR}} found for low-redshift star-forming galaxies applies to high-redshift galaxies and extends at least two orders of magnitude higher in {{{Sigma }}}{{FIR}}. This lends further credence to the claim that the compactness of the IR-emitting region is the controlling parameter in establishing the ``[C ii] deficit.''},

	Abstract = {We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 860 mum imaging of four high-redshift (z = 2.8-5.7) dusty sources that were detected using the South Pole Telescope (SPT) at 1.4 mm and are not seen in existing radio to far-infrared catalogs. At 1.''5 resolution, the ALMA data reveal multiple images of each submillimeter source, separated by 1''-3'', consistent with strong lensing by intervening galaxies visible in near-IR imaging of these sources. We describe a gravitational lens modeling procedure that operates on the measured visibilities and incorporates self-calibration-like antenna phase corrections as part of the model optimization, which we use to interpret the source structure. Lens models indicate that SPT0346-52, located at z = 5.7, is one of the most luminous and intensely star-forming sources in the universe with a lensing corrected FIR luminosity of 3.7 × 1013 L &sun; and star formation surface density of 4200 M &sun; yr-1 kpc-2. We find magnification factors of 5 to 22, with lens Einstein radii of 1.''1-2.''0 and Einstein enclosed masses of 1.6-7.2 × 1011 M &sun;. These observations confirm the lensing origin of these objects, allow us to measure their intrinsic sizes and luminosities, and demonstrate the important role that ALMA will play in the interpretation of lensed submillimeter sources.},

	Abstract = {We present high-resolution maps of stars, dust, and molecular gas in a strongly lensed submillimeter galaxy (SMG) at z = 3.259. HATLAS J114637.9-001132 is selected from the Herschel-Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey (H-ATLAS) as a strong lens candidate mainly based on its unusually high 500 mum flux density (~300 mJy). It is the only high-redshift Planck detection in the 130 deg2 H-ATLAS Phase-I area. Keck Adaptive Optics images reveal a quadruply imaged galaxy in the K band while the Submillimeter Array and the Jansky Very Large Array show doubly imaged 880 mum and CO(1-->0) sources, indicating differentiated distributions of the various components in the galaxy. In the source plane, the stars reside in three major kpc-scale clumps extended over ~1.6 kpc, the dust in a compact (~1 kpc) region ~3 kpc north of the stars, and the cold molecular gas in an extended (~7 kpc) disk ~5 kpc northeast of the stars. The emissions from the stars, dust, and gas are magnified by ~17, ~8, and ~7 times, respectively, by four lensing galaxies at z ~ 1. Intrinsically, the lensed galaxy is a warm (T dust ~ 40-65 K), hyper-luminous (L IR ~ 1.7 × 1013 L &sun; star formation rate (SFR) ~2000 M &sun; yr-1), gas-rich (M gas/M baryon ~ 70%), young (M stellar/SFR ~ 20 Myr), and short-lived (M gas/SFR ~ 40 Myr) starburst. With physical properties similar to unlensed z > 2 SMGs, HATLAS J114637.9-001132 offers a detailed view of a typical SMG through a powerful cosmic microscope.},

	Abstract = {MS 0451.6-0305 is a rich galaxy cluster whose strong lensing is particularly prominent at submm wavelengths. We combine new Submillimetre Common-User Bolometer Array (SCUBA)-2 data with imaging from Herschel Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE) and PACS and Hubble Space Telescope in order to try to understand the nature of the sources being lensed. In the region of the `giant submm arc', we uncover seven multiply imaged galaxies (up from the previously known four), of which six are found to be at a redshift of z ˜ 2.9, and possibly constitute an interacting system. Using a novel forward-modelling approach, we are able to simultaneously deblend and fit spectral energy distributions to the individual galaxies that contribute to the giant submm arc, constraining their dust temperatures, far-infrared luminosities, and star formation rates (SFRs). The submm arc first identified by SCUBA can now be seen to be composed of at least five distinct sources, four of these within a galaxy group at z ˜ 2.9. Only a handful of lensed galaxy groups at this redshift are expected on the sky, and thus this is a unique opportunity for studying such systems in detail. The total unlensed luminosity for this galaxy group is (3.1 $\pm$ 0.3) × 1012 L&sun;, which gives an unlensed SFR of (450 $\pm$ 50) M&sun; yr-1. This finding suggests that submm source multiplicity, due to physically associated groupings as opposed to chance alignment, extends to fainter flux densities than previously discovered. Many of these systems may also host optical companions undetected in the submm, as is the case here.},

	Abstract = {We report on the galaxy MACSJ0032-arc (z=3.6314) discovered during the Herschel Lensing snapshot Survey of massive galaxy clusters and strongly lensed by the cluster MACSJ0032.1+1808. The successful detections of its rest-frame UV, optical, FIR, millimeter, and radio continua as well as of CO emission enable us to characterise, for the first time at such a high redshift, the stellar, dust, and molecular gas properties of a normal star-forming galaxy with a stellar mass of 4.8x10^9 Msun and an IR luminosity of 4.8x10^{11} Lsun. We find that the bulk of the molecular gas mass and star formation seems to be spatially decoupled from the rest-frame UV emission. About 90% of the total star formation rate is seen through the thermal FIR dust emission and the radio synchrotron radiation, and is undetected at rest-frame UV wavelengths because of severe obscuration by dust. The observed CO(1-0), CO(4-3) and CO(6-5) lines demonstrate that high-J transitions, at least up to J=6, remain excited in this galaxy, whose CO spectral line energy distribution resembles that of high-redshift submm galaxies, even though the IR luminosity of MACSJ0032-arc is 10 times lower. This high CO excitation is possibly due to the compactness of the galaxy. We find evidence that this high CO excitation has to be considered in the balance when estimating the CO-to-H_2 conversion factor. Indeed, the respective CO-to-H_2 conversion factors as derived from the correlation with metallicity and the FIR dust continuum can be nicely reconciled if excitation corrections are accounted for. The inferred depletion timescale of the molecular gas in MACSJ0032-arc confirms the decrease of tdepl with redshift, although to a lesser degree than predicted by models, whereas the deduced molecular gas fraction suggests a continued increase of fmolgas with redshift as expected, despite the plateau observed between z~1.5 and z~2.5.},

	Abstract = {Observations and theoretical simulations have established a framework for galaxy formation and evolution in the young Universe. Galaxies formed as baryonic gas cooled at the centres of collapsing dark-matter haloes; mergers of haloes and galaxies then led to the hierarchical build-up of galaxy mass. It remains unclear, however, over what timescales galaxies were assembled and when and how bulges and disks-the primary components of present-day galaxies-were formed. It is also puzzling that the most massive galaxies were more abundant and were forming stars more rapidly at early epochs than expected from models. Here we report high-angular-resolution observations of a representative luminous star-forming galaxy when the Universe was only 20% of its current age. A large and massive rotating protodisk is channelling gas towards a growing central stellar bulge hosting an accreting massive black hole. The high surface densities of gas, the high rate of star formation and the moderately young stellar ages suggest rapid assembly, fragmentation and conversion to stars of an initially very gas-rich protodisk, with no obvious evidence for a major merger.},

@article{Behroozi:2013vn,
	Abstract = {Using reconstructed galaxy star formation histories, we calculate the instantaneous efficiency of galaxy star formation (i.e., the star formation rate divided by the baryon accretion rate) from z = 8 to the present day. This efficiency exhibits a clear peak near a characteristic halo mass of 1011.7 M &sun;, which coincides with longstanding theoretical predictions for the mass scale relevant to virial shock heating of accreted gas. Above the characteristic halo mass, the efficiency falls off as the mass to the minus four-thirds power; below the characteristic mass, the efficiency falls off at an average scaling of mass to the two-thirds power. By comparison, the shape and normalization of the efficiency change very little since z = 4. We show that a time-independent star formation efficiency simply explains the shape of the cosmic star formation rate since z = 4 in terms of dark matter accretion rates. The rise in the cosmic star formation from early times until z = 2 is especially sensitive to galaxy formation efficiency. The mass dependence of the efficiency strongly limits where most star formation occurs, with the result that two-thirds of all star formation has occurred inside halos within a factor of three of the characteristic mass, a range that includes the mass of the Milky Way.},

@article{Keres:2005yq,
	Abstract = {We examine the temperature history of gas accreted by forming galaxies in smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations. About half of the gas follows the track expected in the conventional picture of galaxy formation, shock heating to roughly the virial temperature of the galaxy potential well (T~ 106 K for a Milky Way type galaxy) before cooling, condensing and forming stars. However, the other half radiates its acquired gravitational energy at much lower temperatures, typically T < 105 K, and the histogram of maximum gas temperatures is clearly bimodal. The `cold mode' of gas accretion dominates for low-mass galaxies (baryonic mass Mgal<~ 1010.3Msolar or halo mass Mhalo<~ 1011.4Msolar), while the conventional `hot mode' dominates the growth of high-mass systems. Cold accretion is often directed along filaments, allowing galaxies to efficiently draw gas from large distances, while hot accretion is quasi-spherical. The galaxy and halo mass dependence leads to redshift and environment dependence of cold and hot accretion rates, with the cold mode dominating at high redshift and in low-density regions today, and the hot mode dominating in group and cluster environments at low redshift. The simulations reproduce an important feature of the observed relation between the galaxy star formation rate (SFR) and the environment, namely a break in star formation rates at surface densities Sigma~ 1h275 Mpc-2, outside the virial radii of large groups and clusters. The cosmic SFR tracks the overall history of gas accretion, and its decline at low redshift follows the combined decline of cold and hot accretion rates. The drop in cold accretion is driven by the decreasing infall rate on to haloes, while for hot accretion this slower mass growth is further modified by the longer cooling times within haloes. If we allowed hot accretion to be suppressed by conduction or active galactic nuclei feedback, then the simulation predictions would change in interesting ways, perhaps resolving conflicts with the colours of ellipticals and the cut-off of the galaxy luminosity function. The transition at Mhalo~ 1011.4Msolar between cold-mode domination and hot-mode domination is similar to that found by Birnboim & Dekel using one-dimensional simulations and analytic arguments. The corresponding baryonic mass is tantalizingly close to the scale at which Kauffmann et al. find a marked shift in galaxy properties, and we speculate on possible connections between these theoretical and observational transitions.},

	Abstract = {We report the discovery of a unique gravitational lens system, SDSS J2222+2745, producing five spectroscopically confirmed images of a zs = 2.82 quasar lensed by a foreground galaxy cluster at zl = 0.49. We also present photometric and spectroscopic evidence for a sixth lensed image of the same quasar. The maximum separation between the quasar images is 15.''1. Both the large image separations and the high image multiplicity are in themselves rare among known lensed quasars, and observing the combination of these two factors is an exceptionally unlikely occurrence in present data sets. This is only the third known case of a quasar lensed by a cluster, and the only one with six images. The lens system was discovered in the course of the Sloan Giant Arcs Survey, in which we identify candidate lenses in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and target these for follow-up and verification with the 2.56 m Nordic Optical Telescope. Multi-band photometry obtained over multiple epochs from 2011 September to 2012 September reveals significant variability at the ~10%-30% level in some of the quasar images, indicating that measurements of the relative time delay between quasar images will be feasible. In this lens system, we also identify a bright (g = 21.5) giant arc corresponding to a strongly lensed background galaxy at zs = 2.30. We fit parametric models of the lens system, constrained by the redshift and positions of the quasar images and the redshift and position of the giant arc. The predicted time delays between different pairs of quasar images range from ~100 days to ~6 yr.  Based on observations made with the Nordic Optical Telescope, operated on the island of La Palma jointly by Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, in the Spanish Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos of the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias.},

@article{Bouwens:2014zp,
	Abstract = {We utilize a two-color Lyman-break selection criterion to search for z ~ 9-10 galaxies over the first 19 clusters in the CLASH program. A systematic search yields three z ~ 9-10 candidates. While we have already reported the most robust of these candidates, MACS1149-JD, two additional z ~ 9 candidates are also found and have H 160-band magnitudes of ~26.2-26.9. A careful assessment of various sources of contamination suggests lsim1 contaminants for our z ~ 9-10 selection. To determine the implications of these search results for the luminosity function (LF) and star formation rate density at z ~ 9, we introduce a new differential approach to deriving these quantities in lensing fields. Our procedure is to derive the evolution by comparing the number of z ~ 9-10 galaxy candidates found in CLASH with the number of galaxies in a slightly lower-redshift sample (after correcting for the differences in selection volumes), here taken to be z ~ 8. This procedure takes advantage of the fact that the relative volumes available for the z ~ 8 and z ~ 9-10 selections behind lensing clusters are not greatly dependent on the details of the lensing models. We find that the normalization of the UV LF at z ~ 9 is just 0.28-0.20+0.39× that at z ~ 8, which is ~1.4-0.8+3.0× lower than extrapolating z ~ 4-8 LF results. While consistent with the evolution in the UV LF seen at z ~ 4-8, these results marginally favor a more rapid evolution at z > 8. Compared to similar evolutionary findings from the HUDF, our result is less insensitive to large-scale structure uncertainties, given our many independent sightlines on the high-redshift universe.  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

	Abstract = {Gravitational lensing magnification is measured with a significance of 9.7sigma on a large sample of galaxy clusters in the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS). This survey covers ˜154 deg2 and contains over 18 000 cluster candidates at redshifts 0.2 <= z <= 0.9, detected using the 3D-Matched Filter cluster-finder of Milkeraitis et al. We fit composite-NFW models to the ensemble, accounting for cluster miscentring, source-lens redshift overlap, as well as nearby structure (the two-halo term), and recover mass estimates of the cluster dark matter haloes in range of ˜1013 M&sun; to 2 × 1014 M&sun;. Cluster richness is measured for the entire sample, and we bin the clusters according to both richness and redshift. A mass-richness relation M200 = M0(N200/20)beta is fit to the measurements. For two different cluster miscentring models, we find consistent results for the normalization and slope, M0 = (2.3 $\pm$ 0.2) × 1013 M&sun;, beta = 1.4 $\pm$ 0.1 and M0 = (2.2 $\pm$ 0.2) × 1013 M&sun;, beta = 1.5 $\pm$ 0.1. We find that accounting for the full redshift distribution of lenses and sources is important, since any overlap can have an impact on mass estimates inferred from flux magnification.},

	Abstract = {We examine the Mg II 2796, 2803 {\AA}, Lyalpha, and nebular line emission in five bright star-forming galaxies at 1.66 < z < 1.91 that have been gravitationally lensed by foreground galaxy clusters. All five galaxies show prominent Mg II emission and absorption in a P Cygni profile. We find no correlation between the equivalent widths of Mg II and Lyalpha emission. The Mg II emission has a broader range of velocities than do the nebular emission line profiles; the Mg II emission is redshifted with respect to systemic by 100-200 km s-1. When present, Lyalpha is even more redshifted. The reddest components of Mg II and Lyalpha emission have tails to 500-600 km s-1, implying a strong outflow. The lack of correlation in the Mg II and Lyalpha equivalent widths, the differing velocity profiles, and the high ratios of Mg II to nebular line fluxes together suggest that the bulk of Mg II emission does not ultimately arise as nebular line emission, but may instead be reprocessed stellar continuum emission.},

	Abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) G141 grism spectroscopy for seven star-forming regions of the highly magnified lensed starburst galaxy RCSGA 032727-132609 at z = 1.704. We measure the spatial variations of the extinction in RCS0327 through the observed Hgamma/Hbeta emission line ratios, finding a constant average extinction of E(B - V)gas = 0.40 $\pm$ 0.07. We infer that the star formation is enhanced as a result of an ongoing interaction, with measured star formation rates derived from demagnified, extinction-corrected Hbeta line fluxes for the individual star-forming clumps falling >1-2 dex above the star formation sequence. When combining the HST/WFC3 [O III] lambda5007/Hbeta emission line ratio measurements with [N II]/Halpha line ratios from Wuyts et al., we find that the majority of the individual star-forming regions fall along the local "normal" abundance sequence. With the first detections of the He I lambda5876 and He II lambda4686 recombination lines in a distant galaxy, we probe the massive-star content of the star-forming regions in RCS0327. The majority of the star-forming regions have a He I lambda5876 to Hbeta ratio consistent with the saturated maximum value, which is only possible if they still contain hot O-stars. Two regions have lower ratios, implying that their last burst of new star formation ended ~5 Myr ago. Together, the He I lambda5876 and He II lambda4686 to Hbeta line ratios provide indirect evidence for the order in which star formation is stopping in individual star-forming knots of this high-redshift merger. We place the spatial variations of the extinction, star formation rate and ionization conditions in the context of the star formation history of RCS0327.},

	Abstract = {We present comprehensive analyses of faint dropout galaxies up to z ~ 10 with the first full-depth data set of the A2744 lensing cluster and parallel fields observed by the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) program. We identify 54 dropouts at z ~ 5-10 in the HFF fields and enlarge the size of the z ~ 9 galaxy sample obtained to date. Although the number of highly magnified (mu ~ 10) galaxies is small because of the tiny survey volume of strong lensing, our study reaches the galaxies' intrinsic luminosities comparable to the deepest-field HUDF studies. We derive UV luminosity functions with these faint dropouts, carefully evaluating by intensive simulations the combination of observational incompleteness and lensing effects in the image plane, including magnification, distortion, and multiplication of images, with the evaluation of mass model dependencies. Our results confirm that the faint-end slope, alpha, is as steep as -2 at z ~ 6-8 and strengthen the evidence for the rapid decrease of UV luminosity densities, rhoUV, at z > 8 from the large z ~ 9 sample. We examine whether the rapid rhoUV decrease trend can be reconciled with the large Thomson scattering optical depth, taue, measured by cosmic microwave background experiments, allowing a large space of free parameters, such as an average ionizing photon escape fraction and a stellar-population-dependent conversion factor. No parameter set can reproduce both the rapid rhoUV decrease and the large tau e . It is possible that the rhoUV decrease moderates at z >~ 11, that the free parameters significantly evolve toward high z, or that there exist additional sources of reionization such as X-ray binaries and faint active galactic nuclei.},

	Abstract = {We search the complete Hubble Frontier Field data set of Abell 2744 and its parallel field for z~ 10 sources to further refine the evolution of the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD) between z~ 8 and z~ 10. We independently confirm two images of the recently discovered triply imaged z~ 9.8 source by Zitrin et al. and set an upper limit for similar z~ 10 galaxies with red colors of {J}125-{H}160\gt 1.2 in the parallel field of Abell 2744. We utilize extensive simulations to derive the effective selection volume of Lyman-break galaxies at z~ 10, both in the lensed cluster field and in the adjacent parallel field. Particular care is taken to include position-dependent lensing shear to accurately account for the expected sizes and morphologies of highly magnified sources. We show that both source blending and shear reduce the completeness at a given observed magnitude in the cluster, particularly near the critical curves. These effects have a significant, but largely overlooked, impact on the detectability of high-redshift sources behind clusters, and substantially reduce the expected number of highly magnified sources. The detections and limits from both pointings result in an SFRD which is consistent within the uncertainties with previous estimates at z~ 10 from blank fields. The combination of these new results with all other estimates is also consistent with a rapidly declining SFRD in the 170 Myr from z~ 8 to z~ 10 as predicted by cosmological simulations and dark-matter halo evolution in LambdaCDM. Once biases introduced by magnification-dependent completeness are accounted for, the full six cluster and parallel Frontier Field program will be an extremely powerful new data set to probe the evolution of the galaxy population at z\gt 8 before the advent of the James Webb Space Telescope.  Based on data obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope operated by AURA, Inc. for NASA under contract NAS5-26555.},

	Abstract = {The relation between mass and concentration of galaxy clusters traces their formation and evolution. Massive lensing clusters were observed to be overconcentrated and following a steep scaling in tension with predictions from the concordance Lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) paradigm. We critically revise the relation in the CLASH (Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble), the SGAS (Sloan Giant Arcs Survey), the LOCUSS (Local Cluster Substructure Survey), and the high-redshift samples of weak lensing clusters. Measurements of mass and concentration are anti-correlated, which can bias the observed relation towards steeper values. We corrected for this bias and compared the measured relation to theoretical predictions accounting for halo triaxiality, adiabatic contraction of the halo, presence of a dominant brightest cluster galaxy, and, mostly, selection effects in the observed sample. The normalization, the slope, and the scatter of the expected relation are strongly sample-dependent. For the considered samples, the predicted slope is much steeper than that of the underlying relation characterizing dark matter-only clusters. We found that the correction for statistical and selection biases in observed relations mostly solve the tension with the LambdaCDM model.},

	Abstract = {We observed Hubble Deep Field South with the new panoramic integral-field spectrograph MUSE that we built and have just commissioned at the VLT. The data cube resulting from 27 h of integration covers one arcmin2 field of view at an unprecedented depth with a 1sigma emission-line surface brightness limit of 1 × 10-19 erg s-1 cm-2 arcsec-2, and contains ~90 000 spectra. We present the combined and calibrated data cube, and we performed a first-pass analysis of the sources detected in the Hubble Deep Field South imaging. We measured the redshifts of 189 sources up to a magnitude I814 = 29.5, increasing the number of known spectroscopic redshifts in this field by more than an order of magnitude. We also discovered 26 Lyalpha emitting galaxies that are not detected in the HST WFPC2 deep broad-band images. The intermediate spectral resolution of 2.3 {\AA} allows us to separate resolved asymmetric Lyalpha emitters, [O ii]3727 emitters, and C iii]1908 emitters, and the broad instantaneous wavelength range of 4500 {\AA} helps to identify single emission lines, such as [O iii]5007, Hbeta, and Halpha, over a very wide redshift range. We also show how the three-dimensional information of MUSE helps to resolve sources that are confused at ground-based image quality. Overall, secure identifications are provided for 83% of the 227 emission line sources detected in the MUSE data cube and for 32% of the 586 sources identified in the HST catalogue. The overall redshift distribution is fairly flat to z = 6.3, with a reduction between z = 1.5 to 2.9, in the well-known redshift desert. The field of view of MUSE also allowed us to detect 17 groups within the field. We checked that the number counts of [O ii]3727 and Lyalpha emitters are roughly consistent with predictions from the literature. Using two examples, we demonstrate that MUSE is able to provide exquisite spatially resolved spectroscopic information on the intermediate-redshift galaxies present in the field. Thisunique data set can be used for a wide range of follow-up studies. We release the data cube, the associated products, and the source catalogue with redshifts, spectra, and emission-line fluxes.

	Abstract = {Gravitational lensing has become one of the most powerful tools available for investigating the ``dark side'' of the universe. Cosmological strong gravitational lensing, in particular, probes the properties of the dense cores of dark matter halos over decades in mass and offers the opportunity to study the distant universe at flux levels and spatial resolutions otherwise unavailable. Studies of strongly lensed variable sources offer even further scientific opportunities. One of the challenges in realizing the potential of strong lensing is to understand the statistical context of both the individual systems that receive extensive follow-up study, as well as that of the larger samples of strong lenses that are now emerging from survey efforts. Motivated by these challenges, we have developed an image simulation pipeline, Pipeline for Images of Cosmological Strong lensing (PICS), to generate realistic strong gravitational lensing signals from group- and cluster-scale lenses. PICS uses a low-noise and unbiased density estimator based on (resampled) Delaunay Tessellations to calculate the density field; lensed images are produced by ray-tracing images of actual galaxies from deep Hubble Space Telescope observations. Other galaxies, similarly sampled, are added to fill in the light cone. The pipeline further adds cluster member galaxies and foreground stars into the lensed images. The entire image ensemble is then observed using a realistic point-spread function that includes appropriate detector artifacts for bright stars. Noise is further added, including such non-Gaussian elements as noise window-paning from mosaiced observations, residual bad pixels, and cosmic rays. The aim is to produce simulated images that appear identical---to the eye (expert or otherwise)---to real observations in various imaging surveys.},

	Abstract = {Until now, systematic errors in strong gravitational lens modeling have been acknowledged but have never been fully quantified. Here, we launch an investigation into the systematics induced by constraint selection. We model the simulated cluster Ares 362 times using random selections of image systems with and without spectroscopic redshifts and quantify the systematics using several diagnostics: image predictability, accuracy of model-predicted redshifts, enclosed mass, and magnification. We find that for models with >15 image systems, the image plane rms does not decrease significantly when more systems are added; however, the rms values quoted in the literature may be misleading as to the ability of a model to predict new multiple images. The mass is well constrained near the Einstein radius in all cases, and systematic error drops to <2% for models using >10 image systems. Magnification errors are smallest along the straight portions of the critical curve, and the value of the magnification is systematically lower near curved portions. For >15 systems, the systematic error on magnification is ~2%. We report no trend in magnification error with the fraction of spectroscopic image systems when selecting constraints at random; however, when using the same selection of constraints, increasing this fraction up to ~0.5 will increase model accuracy. The results suggest that the selection of constraints, rather than quantity alone, determines the accuracy of the magnification. We note that spectroscopic follow-up of at least a few image systems is crucial because models without any spectroscopic redshifts are inaccurate across all of our diagnostics.},

	Abstract = {We present adaptive optics assisted integral field spectroscopy of nine Halpha-selected galaxies at z = 0.84-2.23 drawn from the HiZELS narrowband survey. Our observations map the kinematics of these star-forming galaxies on ~kpc scales. We demonstrate that within the interstellar medium of these galaxies, the velocity dispersion of the star-forming gas (sigma) follows a scaling relation sigmavpropSigma1/n  SFR + constant (where SigmaSFR is the star formation surface density and the constant includes the stellar surface density). Assuming the disks are marginally stable (Toomre Q = 1), this follows from the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation (SigmaSFR = ASigma n  gas), and we derive best-fit parameters of n = 1.34 $\pm$ 0.15 and A = 3.4+2.5 -1.6 × 10-4 M &sun; yr-1 kpc-2, consistent with the local relation, and implying cold molecular gas masses of M gas = 109-10 M &sun; and molecular gas fractions of M gas/(M gas + M sstarf) = 0.3 $\pm$ 0.1, with a range of 10%-75%. We also identify 11 ~kpc-scale star-forming regions (clumps) within our sample and show that their sizes are comparable to the wavelength of the fastest growing mode. The luminosities and velocity dispersions of these clumps follow the same scaling relations as local H II regions, although their star formation densities are a factor ~15 $\pm$ 5 × higher than typically found locally. We discuss how the clump properties are related to the disk, and show that their high masses and luminosities are a consequence of the high disk surface density.},

	Abstract = {We present the properties of eight star-forming regions, or 'clumps,' in three galaxies at z˜ 1.3 from the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey, which are resolved with the OH Suppressing InfraRed Imaging Spectrograph (OSIRIS) integral field spectrograph. Within turbulent discs, sigma˜ 90 km s-1, clumps are measured with average sizes of 1.5 kpc and average Jeans masses of 4.2 × 109 M&sun;, in total accounting for 40-60 per cent of the stellar mass of the discs. These findings lend observational support to models that predict larger clumps will form as a result of higher disc velocity dispersions driven-up by cosmological gas accretion. As a consequence of the changes in global environment, it may be predicted that star-forming regions at high redshift should not resemble star-forming regions locally. Yet despite the increased sizes and dispersions, clumps and H II regions are found to follow tight scaling relations over the range z= 0-2 for Halpha size, velocity dispersion, luminosity and mass when comparing >2000 H II regions locally and 30 clumps at z > 1 (sigma∝r0.42 $\pm$ 0.03, LHalpha∝r2.72 $\pm$ 0.04, LHalpha∝sigma4.18 $\pm$ 0.21 and ?). We discuss these results in the context of the existing simulations of clump formation and evolution, with an emphasis on the processes that drive-up the turbulent motions in the interstellar medium. Our results indicate that while the turbulence of discs may have important implications for the size and luminosity of regions which form within them, the same processes govern their formation from high redshift to the current epoch.},

@article{Liu:2013qy,
	Abstract = {The H II region luminosity function (LF) is an important tool for deriving the birthrates and mass distribution of OB associations and is an excellent tracer of the newly formed massive stars and associations. To date, extensive work (predominantly in Halpha) has been done from the ground, which is hindered by dust extinction and the severe blending of adjacent (spatially or in projection) H II regions. Reliably measuring the properties of H II regions requires a linear resolution <40 pc, but analyses satisfying this requirement have been done only in a handful of galaxies, so far. As the first space-based work using a galaxy sample, we have selected 12 galaxies from our HST/NICMOS Paalpha survey and studied the LF and size distribution of H II regions both in individual galaxies and cumulatively, using a virtually extinction-free tracer of the ionizing photon rate. The high angular resolution and low sensitivity to diffuse emission of NICMOS also offer an advantage over ground-based imaging by enabling a higher degree of de-blending of the H II regions. We do not confirm the broken power-law LFs found in ground-based studies. Instead, we find that the LFs, both individual and co-added, follow a single power law dN(L)/dln LvpropL -1, are consistent with the mass function of star clusters in nearby galaxies, and are in agreement with the results of the existing analyses with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data. The individual and co-added size distributions of H II regions are both roughly consistent with dN(D)/dln DvpropD -3, but the power-law scaling is probably contaminated by blended regions or complexes.  Based on observations taken with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555. These observations are associated with program GO-11080.},

	Abstract = {The distortion of images of faint, high-redshift galaxies by light deflection at foreground clusters of galaxies can be used to determine the (projected) mass distribution of the clusters. The purpose of this paper is to provide a theoretical basis to extend the Kaiser & Squires method into the nonlinear regime, thereby making it more powerful, since the nonlinear distortions provide strong constraints on the mass profile, which in combination with the weak distortions should yield more reliable cluster inversions. We discuss the statistical properties of the observable image ellipticities and provide several methods to determine the local distortion by the lens from observed galaxy images, some of which rely only on the orientations of the images, not on their ellipticities. We then investigate the inversion of spherical clusters: in particular, we show the precision with which the center of a spherical cluster can be determined, both with and without usage of the absolute value of the image ellipticities. We show that inclusion of the absolute value of the ellipticities increases the accuracy of the center position considerably. Finally, we study the fully nonlinear inversion of spherical clusters in some detail, to illustrate the difficulties one has to anticipate in nonlinear reconstructions of realistic two-dimensional matter distributions. We compare the direct nonlinear inversion with the method of fitting parametrized mass profiles to the distortion data, and point out relative strengths and shortcomings. In particular, we emphasize the influence of the aforementioned global invariance transformation and an additional local degeneracy.},

We derive the SN rate in galaxy clusters at 0.06<z<0.19, based on Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) that were discovered by the Wise Observatory Optical Transient Survey. As described in a separate paper, a sample of 140 rich Abell clusters was monitored, in which six cluster SNe Ia were found and confirmed spectroscopically. Here we determine the SN detection efficiencies of the individual survey images and combine the efficiencies with the known spectral properties of SNe Ia to calculate the effective visibility time of the survey. The cluster stellar luminosities are measured from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) database in the griz SDSS bands. Uncertainties are estimated using Monte Carlo simulations in which all input parameters are allowed to vary over their known distributions. We derive SN rates normalized by stellar luminosity, in SNu (supernova units, SNe per century per 1010 Lsolar) in five photometric bandpasses, 0.36+0.22-0.14+/-0.02 (B), 0.351+0.210-0.139+/-0.020 (g), 0.288+0.172-0.114+/-0.018 (r), 0.229+0.137-0.091+/-0.014 (i), and 0.186+0.111-0.074+/-0.010 (z), where the quoted errors are statistical and systematic, respectively. The SN rate per stellar mass unit, derived using a color-luminosity-mass relation, is 0.098+0.059-0.039+/-0.009 SNe (100 yr 1010 Msolar)-1. The low cluster SN rates we find are similar to, and consistent with, the SN Ia rate in local elliptical galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Gravitational lensing by clusters of galaxies offers a powerful probe of their structure and mass distribution. Deriving a lens magnification map for a galaxy cluster is a classic inversion problem and many methods have been developed over the past two decades to solve it. Several research groups have developed techniques independently to map the predominantly dark matter distribution in cluster lenses. While these methods have all provided remarkably high precision mass maps, particularly with exquisite imaging data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), the reconstructions themselves have never been directly compared. In this paper, we report the results of comparing various independent lens modeling techniques employed by individual research groups in the community. Here we present for the first time a detailed and robust comparison of methodologies for fidelity, accuracy and precision. For this collaborative exercise, the lens modeling community was provided simulated cluster images -- of two clusters Ares and Hera -- that mimic the depth and resolution of the ongoing HST Frontier Fields. The results of the submitted reconstructions with the un-blinded true mass profile of these two clusters are presented here. Parametric, free-form and hybrid techniques have been deployed by the participating groups and we detail the strengths and trade-offs in accuracy and systematics that arise for each methodology. We note in conclusion that lensing reconstruction methods produce reliable mass distributions that enable the use of clusters as extremely valuable astrophysical laboratories and cosmological probes.},

	Abstract = {We present a high-precision mass model of the galaxy cluster MACSJ0416.1-2403, based on a strong-gravitational-lensing analysis of the recently acquired Hubble Space Telescope Frontier Fields (HFF) imaging data. Taking advantage of the unprecedented depth provided by HST/Advanced Camera for Survey observations in three passbands, we identify 51 new multiply imaged galaxies, quadrupling the previous census and bringing the grand total to 68, comprising 194 individual lensed images. Having selected a subset of the 57 most securely identified multiply imaged galaxies, we use the LENSTOOL software package to constrain a lens model comprised of two cluster-scale dark-matter haloes and 98 galaxy-scale haloes. Our best-fitting model predicts image positions with an rms error of 0.68 arcsec, which constitutes an improvement of almost a factor of 2 over previous, pre-HFF models of this cluster. We find the total projected mass inside a 200 kpc aperture to be (1.60 $\pm$ 0.01) × 1014 M&sun;, a measurement that offers a three-fold improvement in precision, reaching the per cent level for the first time in any cluster. Finally, we quantify the increase in precision of the derived gravitational magnification of high-redshift galaxies and find an improvement by a factor of ˜2.5 in the statistical uncertainty. Our findings impressively confirm that HFF imaging has indeed opened the domain of high-precision mass measurements for massive clusters of galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We use a joint optical/X-ray analysis to constrain the geometry and history of the ongoing merging event in the massive galaxy cluster MACSJ0416.1-2403 (z = 0.397). Our investigation of cluster substructure rests primarily on a combined strong- and weak-lensing mass reconstruction based on the deep, high-resolution images obtained for the Hubble Frontier Fields initiative. To reveal the system's dynamics, we complement this lensing analysis with a study of the intracluster gas using shallow Chandra data, and a three-dimensional model of the distribution and motions of cluster galaxies derived from over 100 spectroscopic redshifts. The multiscale grid model obtained from our combined lensing analysis extends the high-precision strong-lensing mass reconstruction recently performed to cluster-centric distances of almost 1 Mpc. Our analysis detects the two well-known mass concentrations in the cluster core. A pronounced offset between collisional and collisionless matter is only observed for the SW cluster component, while excellent alignment is found for the NE cluster. Both the lensing analysis and the distribution of cluster light strongly suggest the presence of a third massive structure, almost 2 arcmin SW of the cluster centre. Since no X-ray emission is detected in this region, we conclude that this structure is non-virialized and speculate that it might be part of a large-scale filament almost aligned with our line of sight. Combining all evidence from the distribution of dark and luminous matter, we propose two alternative scenarios for the trajectories of the components of MACSJ0416.1-2403. Upcoming deep X-ray observations that allow the detection of shock fronts, cold cores, and sloshing gas (all key diagnostics for studies of cluster collisions) will allow us to test, and distinguish between these two scenarios.},

	Abstract = {The deflection angles of lensed sources increase with their distance behind a given lens. We utilize this geometric effect to corroborate the z phot ~= 9.8 photometric redshift estimate of a faint near-IR dropout, triply imaged by the massive galaxy cluster A2744 in deep Hubble Frontier Fields images. The multiple images of this source follow the same symmetry as other nearby sets of multiple images that bracket the critical curves and have well-defined redshifts (up to z spec ~= 3.6), but with larger deflection angles, indicating that this source must lie at a higher redshift. Similarly, our different parametric and non-parametric lens models all require this object be at z >~ 4, with at least 95% confidence, thoroughly excluding the possibility of lower-redshift interlopers. To study the properties of this source, we correct the two brighter images for their magnifications, leading to a star formation rate of ~0.3 M &sun; yr-1, a stellar mass of ~4 × 107 M &sun;, and an age of <~ 220 Myr (95% confidence). The intrinsic apparent magnitude is 29.9 AB (F160W), and the rest-frame UV (~1500 {\AA}) absolute magnitude is M UV, AB = -17.6. This corresponds to {˜ }0.1  L*z=8 ({˜ }0.2  L*z=10, adopting dM*/dz ~ 0.45), making this candidate one of the least luminous galaxies discovered at z ~ 10.},

	Abstract = {We present an initial study of the mass and evolutionary state of a massive and distant cluster, RCS2 J232727.6-020437. This cluster, at z = 0.6986, is the richest cluster discovered in the RCS2 project. The mass measurements presented in this paper are derived from all possible mass proxies: X-ray measurements, weak-lensing shear, strong lensing, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect decrement, the velocity distribution of cluster member galaxies, and galaxy richness. While each of these observables probe the mass of the cluster at a different radius, they all indicate that RCS2 J232727.6-020437 is among the most massive clusters at this redshift, with an estimated mass of {M}200˜ 3× {10}15{h}70-1 {M}&sun; . In this paper, we demonstrate that the various observables are all reasonably consistent with each other to within their uncertainties.

	Abstract = {We present a strong-lensing analysis of MACSJ0717.5+3745 (hereafter MACS J0717), based on the full depth of the Hubble Frontier Field (HFF) observations, which brings the number of multiply imaged systems to 61, ten of which have been spectroscopically confirmed. The total number of images comprised in these systems rises to 165, compared to 48 images in 16 systems before the HFF observations. Our analysis uses a parametric mass reconstruction technique, as implemented in the Lenstool software, and the subset of the 132 most secure multiple images to constrain a mass distribution composed of four large-scale mass components (spatially aligned with the four main light concentrations) and a multitude of galaxy-scale perturbers. We find a superposition of cored isothermal mass components to provide a good fit to the observational constraints, resulting in a very shallow mass distribution for the smooth (large-scale) component. Given the implications of such a flat mass profile, we investigate whether a model composed of "peaky" non-cored mass components can also reproduce the observational constraints. We find that such a non-cored mass model reproduces the observational constraints equally well, in the sense that both models give comparable total rms. Although the total (smooth dark matter component plus galaxy-scale perturbers) mass distributions of both models are consistent, as are the integrated two-dimensional mass profiles, we find that the smooth and the galaxy-scale components are very different. We conclude that, even in the HFF era, the generic degeneracy between smooth and galaxy-scale components is not broken, in particular in such a complex galaxy cluster. Consequently, insights into the mass distribution of MACS J0717 remain limited, emphasizing the need for additional probes beyond strong lensing. Our findings also have implications for estimates of the lensing magnification. We show that the amplification difference between the two models is larger than the error associated with either model, and that this additional systematic uncertainty is approximately the difference in magnification obtained by the different groups of modelers using pre-HFF data. This uncertainty decreases the area of the image plane where we can reliably study the high-redshift Universe by 50 to 70%.},

	Abstract = {We conduct precise strong lensing mass modeling of four Hubble Frontier Field (HFF) clusters, Abell 2744, MACS J0416.1-2403, MACS J0717.5+3745, and MACS J1149.6+2223, for which HFF imaging observations are completed. We construct a refined sample of more than 100 multiple images for each cluster by taking advantage of the full-depth HFF images, and conduct mass modeling using the glafic software, which assumes simply parametrized mass distributions. Our mass modeling also exploits a magnification constraint from the lensed SN Ia HFF14Tom for Abell 2744 and positional constraints from the multiple images S1-S4 of the lensed supernova SN Refsdal for MACS J1149.6+2223. We find that our best-fitting mass models reproduce the observed image positions with rms errors of ˜0."4, which are smaller than rms errors in previous mass modeling that adopted similar numbers of multiple images. Our model predicts a new image of SN Refsdal with a relative time delay and magnification that are fully consistent with a recent detection of reappearance. We then construct catalogs of z ˜ 6-9 dropout galaxies behind the four clusters and estimate magnification factors for these dropout galaxies with our best-fitting mass models. The dropout sample from the four cluster fields contains ˜120 galaxies at z ≳ 6, about 20 of which are predicted to be magnified by a factor of more than 10. Some of the high-redshift galaxies detected in the HFF have lensing-corrected magnitudes of MUV ˜ -15 to -14. Our analysis demonstrates that the HFF data indeed offer an ideal opportunity to study faint high-redshift galaxies. All lensing maps produced from our mass modeling will be made available on the Space Telescope Science Institute website (https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/frontier/lensmodels/).},

	Abstract = {We present the first observations of the Frontier Fields cluster Abell S1063 taken with the newly commissioned Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) integral field spectrograph. Because of the relatively large field of view (1 arcmin2), MUSE is ideal to simultaneously target multiple galaxies in blank and cluster fields over the full optical spectrum. We analysed the four hours of data obtained in the science verification phase on this cluster and measured redshifts for 53 galaxies. We confirm the redshift of five cluster galaxies, and determine the redshift of 29 other cluster members. Behind the cluster, we find 17 galaxies at higher redshift, including three previously unknown Lyman-alpha emitters at z> 3, and five multiply-lensed galaxies. We report the detection of a new z = 4.113 multiply lensed galaxy, with images that are consistent with lensing model predictions derived for the Frontier Fields. We detect C iii], C iv, and He ii emission in a multiply lensed galaxy at z = 3.116, suggesting the likely presence of an active galactic nucleus. We also created narrow-band images from the MUSE datacube to automatically search for additional line emitters corresponding to high-redshift candidates, but we could not identify any significant detections other than those found by visual inspection. With the new redshifts, it will become possible to obtain an accurate mass reconstruction in the core of Abell S1063 through refined strong lensing modelling. Overall, our results illustrate the breadth of scientific topics that can be addressed with a single MUSE pointing. We conclude that MUSE is a very efficient instrument to observe galaxy clusters, enabling their mass modelling, and to perform a blind search for high-redshift galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We present a high-precision mass model of galaxy cluster Abell 2744, based on a strong gravitational-lensing analysis of the Hubble Space Telescope Frontier Fields (HFF) imaging data, which now include both Advanced Camera for Surveys and Wide Field Camera 3 observations to the final depth. Taking advantage of the unprecedented depth of the visible and near-infrared data, we identify 34 new multiply imaged galaxies, bringing the total to 61, comprising 181 individual lensed images. In the process, we correct previous erroneous identifications and positions of multiple systems in the northern part of the cluster core. With the LENSTOOL software and the new sets of multiple images, we model the cluster using two cluster-scale dark matter haloes plus galaxy-scale haloes for the cluster members. Our best-fitting model predicts image positions with an rms error of 0.79 arcsec, which constitutes an improvement by almost a factor of 2 over previous parametric models of this cluster. We measure the total projected mass inside a 200 kpc aperture as (2.162 $\pm$ 0.005) × 1014 M&sun;, thus reaching 1 per cent level precision for the second time, following the recent HFF measurement of MACSJ0416.1-2403. Importantly, the higher quality of the mass model translates into an overall improvement by a factor of 4 of the derived magnification factor. Together with our previous HFF gravitational lensing analysis, this work demonstrates that the HFF data enables high-precision mass measurements for massive galaxy clusters and the derivation of robust magnification maps to probe the early Universe.},

Starting from the combination of our catalog with those obtained from extensive spectroscopic and photometric campaigns using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we select a sample of 300 (164 spectroscopic and 136 photometric) cluster members, within approximately 500 kpc from the brightest cluster galaxy, and a set of 88 reliable multiple images associated with 10 different background source galaxies and 18 distinct knots in the spiral galaxy hosting SN ``Refsdal.'' We exploit this valuable information to build six detailed strong-lensing models, the best of which reproduces the observed positions of the multiple images with an rms offset of only 0."26. We use these models to quantify the statistical and systematic errors on the predicted values of magnification and time delay of the next emerging image of SN ``Refsdal.'' We find that its peak luminosity should occur between 2016 March and June and should be approximately 20% fainter than the dimmest (S4) of the previously detected images but above the detection limit of the planned HST/WFC3 follow-up. We present our two-dimensional reconstruction of the cluster mass density distribution and of the SN ``Refsdal'' host galaxy surface brightness distribution. We outline the road map toward even better strong-lensing models with a synergetic MUSE and HST effort.  This work is based in large part on data collected at ESO VLT (prog.ID 294.A-5032) and NASA HST.},

	Abstract = {The Frontier Fields program is obtaining deep Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescope images of new "blank" fields and nearby fields gravitationally lensed by massive galaxy clusters. The Hubble images of the lensed fields are revealing nJy sources (AB mag > 31), the faintest galaxies yet observed. The full program will transform our understanding of galaxy evolution in the first 600 million years (z > 9). Previous programs have yielded a dozen or so z > 9 candidates, including perhaps fewer than expected in the Ultra Deep Field and more than expected in shallower Hubble images. In this paper, we present high-redshift (z > 6) number count predictions for the Frontier Fields and candidates in three of the first Hubble images. We show the full Frontier Fields program may yield up to ~70 z > 9 candidates (~6 per field). We base this estimate on an extrapolation of luminosity functions observed between 4 < z < 8 and gravitational lensing models submitted by the community. However, in the first two deep infrared Hubble images obtained to date, we find z ~ 8 candidates but no strong candidates at z > 9. We defer quantitative analysis of the z > 9 deficit (including detection completeness estimates) to future work including additional data. At these redshifts, cosmic variance (field-to-field variation) is expected to be significant (greater than $\pm$50%) and include clustering of early galaxies formed in overdensities. The full Frontier Fields program will significantly mitigate this uncertainty by observing six independent sightlines each with a lensing cluster and nearby blank field.},

	Abstract = {We use deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the Frontier Fields to accurately measure the galaxy rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity function (UV LF) in the redshift range z ˜ 6-8. We combine observations in three lensing clusters, A2744, MACS 0416, and MACS 0717, and their associated parallel fields to select high-redshift dropout candidates. We use the latest lensing models to estimate the flux magnification and the effective survey volume in combination with completeness simulations performed in the source plane. We report the detection of 227 galaxy candidates at z = 6-7 and 25 candidates at z ˜ 8. While the total survey area is about 4 arcmin2 in each parallel field, it drops to about 0.6-1 arcmin2 in the cluster core fields because of the strong lensing. We compute the UV LF at z ˜ 7 using the combined galaxy sample and perform Monte Carlo simulations to determine the best-fit Schechter parameters. We are able to reliably constrain the LF down to an absolute magnitude of MUV = -15.25, which corresponds to 0.005 L*. More importantly, we find that the faint-end slope remains steep down to this magnitude limit with alpha =-{2.04}-0.17+0.13. We find a characteristic magnitude of {M}\star =-{20.89}-0.72+0.60 and log(varphi*) = -{3.54}-0.45+0.48. Our results confirm the most recent results in deep blank fields but extend the LF measurements more than two magnitudes deeper. The UV LF at z ˜ 8 is not very well constrained below MUV = -18 owing to the small number statistics and incompleteness uncertainties. To assess the contribution of galaxies to cosmic reionization, we derive the UV luminosity density at z ˜ 7 by integrating the UV LF down to an observational limit of MUV = -15. We show that our determination of log(rhoUV) = 26.2 $\pm$ 0.13 (erg s-1 Hz-1 Mpc-3) can be sufficient to maintain reionization with an escape fraction of ionizing radiation of fesc = 10%-15%. Future Hubble Frontier Fields observations will certainly improve the constraints on the UV LF at the epoch of reionization, paving the way to more ambitious programs using cosmic telescopes with the next generation of large aperture telescopes such as the James Webb Space Telescope and the European Extremely Large Telescope.  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are associated with programs 13495, 11386, 13389, and 11689. STScI is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. The Hubble Frontier Fields data and the lens models were obtained from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST). This work utilizes gravitational lensing models produced by PIs Ebeling, Merten, and Zitrin, funded as part of the HST Frontier Fields program conducted by STScI.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We present the first public release of photometric redshifts, galaxy rest frame properties and associated magnification values in the cluster and parallel pointings of the first two Frontier Fields, Abell-2744 and MACS-J0416. The released catalogues aim to provide a reference for future investigations of extragalactic populations in these legacy fields: from lensed high-redshift galaxies to cluster members themselves.  Methods: We exploit a multiwavelength catalogue, ranging from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to ground-based K and Spitzer IRAC, which is specifically designed to enable detection and measurement of accurate fluxes in crowded cluster regions. The multiband information is used to derive photometric redshifts and physical properties of sources detected either in the H-band image alone, or from a stack of four WFC3 bands. To minimize systematics, median photometric redshifts are assembled from six different approaches to photo-z estimates. Their reliability is assessed through a comparison with available spectroscopic samples. State-of-the-art lensing models are used to derive magnification values on an object-by-object basis by taking into account sources positions and redshifts.  Results: We show that photometric redshifts reach a remarkable ~3-5% accuracy. After accounting for magnification, the H-band number counts are found to be in agreement at bright magnitudes with number counts from the CANDELS fields, while extending the presently available samples to galaxies that, intrinsically, are as faint as H ~ 32-33, thanks to strong gravitational lensing. The Frontier Fields allow the galaxy stellar mass distribution to be probed, depending on magnification, at 0.5-1.5 dex lower masses with respect to extragalactic wide fields, including sources at Mstar ~ 107-108 M&sun; at z > 5. Similarly, they allow the detection of objects with intrinsic star formation rates (SFRs) >1 dex lower than in the CANDELS fields reaching 0.1-1 M&sun;/yr at z ~ 6-10.  The catalogues, together with the final processed images for all HST bands (as well as some diagnostic data and images), are publicly available and can be downloaded from the Astrodeep website at http://www.astrodeep.eu/frontier-fields/ and from a dedicated CDS webpage (http://astrodeep.u-strasbg.fr/ff/index.html).

	Abstract = {Supernova ``Refsdal,'' multiply imaged by cluster MACS1149.5+2223, represents a rare opportunity to make a true blind test of model predictions in extragalactic astronomy, on a timescale that is short compared to a human lifetime. In order to take advantage of this event, we produced seven gravitational lens models with five independent methods, based on Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Hubble Frontier Field images, along with extensive spectroscopic follow-up observations by HST, the Very Large and the Keck Telescopes. We compare the model predictions and show that they agree reasonably well with the measured time delays and magnification ratios between the known images, even though these quantities were not used as input. This agreement is encouraging, considering that the models only provide statistical uncertainties, and do not include additional sources of uncertainties such as structure along the line of sight, cosmology, and the mass sheet degeneracy. We then present the model predictions for the other appearances of supernova ``Refsdal.'' A future image will reach its peak in the first half of 2016, while another image appeared between 1994 and 2004. The past image would have been too faint to be detected in existing archival images. The future image should be approximately one-third as bright as the brightest known image (i.e., {H}{{AB}}≈ 25.7 mag at peak and {H}{{AB}}≈ 26.7 mag six months before peak), and thus detectable in single-orbit HST images. We will find out soon whether our predictions are correct.},

	Abstract = {Strong gravitational lensing by groups or clusters of galaxies provides a powerful technique to measure the dark matter properties of individual lens galaxies. We study in detail the mass distribution of the satellite lens galaxy in the group-scale lens SL2S J08544-0121 by modelling simultaneously the spatially extended surface brightness distribution of the source galaxy and the lens mass distribution using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. In particular, we measure the dark matter halo size of the satellite lens galaxy to be 6.0+2.9-2.0 kpc with a fiducial velocity dispersion of 127+21-12 km s-1. This is the first time the size of an individual galaxy halo in a galaxy group has been measured using strong gravitational lensing without assumptions of mass following light. We verify the robustness of our halo size measurement using mock data resembling our lens system. Our measurement of the halo size is compatible with the estimated tidal radius of the satellite galaxy, suggesting that halos of galaxies in groups experience significant tidal stripping, a process that has been previously observed on galaxies in clusters. Our mass model of the satellite galaxy is elliptical with its major axis misaligned with that of the light by ~50$\,^{\circ}$. The major axis of the total matter distribution is oriented more towards the centre of the host halo, exhibiting the radial alignment found in N-body simulations and observational studies of satellite galaxies. This misalignment between mass and light poses a significant challenge to modified Newtonian dynamics.  Based in part on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are associated with program 10876.},

	Abstract = {Measuring the relative mass contributions of luminous and dark matter in spiral galaxies is important for understanding their formation and evolution. The combination of a galaxy rotation curve and strong lensing is a powerful way to break the disk-halo degeneracy that is inherent in each of the methods individually. We present an analysis of the 10 image radio spiral lens B1933+503 at z l = 0.755, incorporating (1) new global very long baseline interferometry observations, (2) new adaptive-optics-assisted K-band imaging, and (3) new spectroscopic observations for the lens galaxy rotation curve and the source redshift. We construct a three-dimensionally axisymmetric mass distribution with three components: an exponential profile for the disk, a point mass for the bulge, and a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile for the halo. The mass model is simultaneously fitted to the kinematics and the lensing data. The NFW halo needs to be oblate with a flattening of a/c = 0.33+0.07 -0.05 to be consistent with the radio data. This suggests that baryons are effective at making the halos oblate near the center. The lensing and kinematics analysis probe the inner ~10 kpc of the galaxy, and we obtain a lower limit on the halo scale radius of 16 kpc (95% credible intervals). The dark matter mass fraction inside a sphere with a radius of 2.2 disk scale lengths is f DM, 2.2 = 0.43+0.10 -0.09. The contribution of the disk to the total circular velocity at 2.2 disk scale lengths is 0.76+0.05 -0.06, suggesting that the disk is marginally submaximal. The stellar mass of the disk from our modeling is log10(M */M &sun;) = 11.06+0.09 -0.11 assuming that the cold gas contributes ~20% to the total disk mass. In comparison to the stellar masses estimated from stellar population synthesis models, the stellar initial mass function of Chabrier is preferred to that of Salpeter by a probability factor of 7.2.},

	Abstract = {H-alpha emission-line fluxes have been measured for all of the detected H II regions in 30 nearby spiral and irregular galaxies, and these data are used to study the behavior of the H II region luminosity functions (LFs). In most galaxies, the LF is well represented by a power law function. Both the normalization and the shape of the LF change systematically with Hubble type. Early-type spirals possess fewer H II regions of all luminosities, a steeper LF, and in many cases an upper cutoff or turnover in the LF. Taken together, these effects account for the virtual absence of 'supergiant' H II regions such as 30 Doradus in Sa-Sb galaxies. Most of the massive stars in late-type spiral and irregular galaxies form in large H II/OB complexes, while in early-type spirals the bulk of the massive star formation occurs in small regions ionized by no more than a few OB stars.},

We use the clusters' optically derived properties to estimate photometric redshifts, optical luminosities, richness, and masses. We complement the optical measurements with archival XMM-Newton and ROSAT X-ray data which provide additional luminosity and mass constraints on a modest fraction of the cluster sample. Two of our clusters show clear evidence for central lensing arcs; one of these has a spectacular large diameter, nearly complete Einstein Ring surrounding the brightest cluster galaxy. A strong motivation for this study is to identify the massive clusters that are expected to display prominent signals from the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) and therefore be detected in the wide-area millimeter-band surveys being conducted by both the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and the South Pole Telescope. The optical sample presented here will be useful for verifying new SZE cluster candidates from these surveys, for testing the cluster selection function, and for stacking analyses of the SZE data.},

@article{Ebeling:2014rf,
	Abstract = {Ram-pressure stripping by the gaseous intracluster medium has been proposed as the dominant physical mechanism driving the rapid evolution of galaxies in dense environments. Detailed studies of this process have, however, largely been limited to relatively modest examples affecting only the outermost gas layers of galaxies in nearby and/or low-mass galaxy clusters. We here present results from our search for extreme cases of gas-galaxy interactions in much more massive, X-ray selected clusters at z > 0.3. Using Hubble Space Telescope snapshots in the F606W and F814W passbands, we have discovered dramatic evidence of ram-pressure stripping in which copious amounts of gas are first shock compressed and then removed from galaxies falling into the cluster. Vigorous starbursts triggered by this process across the galaxy-gas interface and in the debris trail cause these galaxies to temporarily become some of the brightest cluster members in the F606W passband, capable of outshining even the Brightest Cluster Galaxy. Based on the spatial distribution and orientation of systems viewed nearly edge-on in our survey, we speculate that infall at large impact parameter gives rise to particularly long-lasting stripping events. Our sample of six spectacular examples identified in clusters from the Massive Cluster Survey, all featuring M F606W < -21 mag, doubles the number of such systems presently known at z > 0.2 and facilitates detailed quantitative studies of the most violent galaxy evolution in clusters.  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.

A total of 677 (409) cluster candidates are identified above a signal-to-noise threshold of xi = 4.5 (5.0). Ground- and space-based optical and near-infrared (NIR) imaging confirms overdensities of similarly colored galaxies in the direction of 516 (or 76%) of the xi > 4.5 candidates and 387 (or 95%) of the xi > 5 candidates; the measured purity is consistent with expectations from simulations. Of these confirmed clusters, 415 were first identified in SPT data, including 251 new discoveries reported in this work. We estimate photometric redshifts for all candidates with identified optical and/or NIR counterparts; we additionally report redshifts derived from spectroscopic observations for 141 of these systems. The mass threshold of the catalog is roughly independent of redshift above z ~ 0.25 leading to a sample of massive clusters that extends to high redshift. The median mass of the sample is M 500c(rhocrit) ˜ 3.5× 1014 M_&sun;  h70-1, the median redshift is z med = 0.55, and the highest-redshift systems are at z > 1.4. The combination of large redshift extent, clean selection, and high typical mass makes this cluster sample of particular interest for cosmological analyses and studies of cluster formation and evolution.},

	Abstract = {We present a new determination of the concentration-mass (c-M) relation for galaxy clusters based on our comprehensive lensing analysis of 19 X-ray selected galaxy clusters from the Cluster Lensing and Supernova Survey with Hubble (CLASH). Our sample spans a redshift range between 0.19 and 0.89. We combine weak-lensing constraints from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and from ground-based wide-field data with strong lensing constraints from HST. The results are reconstructions of the surface-mass density for all CLASH clusters on multi-scale grids. Our derivation of Navarro-Frenk-White parameters yields virial masses between 0.53× {{10}15} {{M}&sun; }/h and 1.76× {{10}15} {{M}&sun; }/h and the halo concentrations are distributed around {{c}200c}˜ 3.7 with a 1sigma  significant negative slope with cluster mass. We find an excellent 4% agreement in the median ratio of our measured concentrations for each cluster and the respective expectation from numerical simulations after accounting for the CLASH selection function based on X-ray morphology. The simulations are analyzed in two dimensions to account for possible biases in the lensing reconstructions due to projection effects. The theoretical c-M relation from our X-ray selected set of simulated clusters and the c-M relation derived directly from the CLASH data agree at the 90% confidence level.},

	Abstract = {Bright gravitationally lensed galaxies provide our most detailed view of galaxies at high redshift. The very brightest (r < 21) systems enable high spatial and spectral resolution measurements, offering unique constraints on the outflow energetics, metallicity gradients and stellar populations in high-redshift galaxies. Yet as a result of the small number of ultrabright z ~= 2 lensed systems with confirmed redshifts, most detailed spectroscopic studies have been limited in their scope. With the goal of increasing the number of bright lensed galaxies available for detailed follow-up, we have undertaken a spectroscopic campaign targeting wide separation (≳3 arcsec) galaxy-galaxy lens candidates within the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Building on the earlier efforts of our Cambridge and Sloan Survey Of Wide Arcs in Thesky survey, we target a large sample of candidate galaxy-galaxy lens systems in SDSS using a well-established search algorithm which identifies blue arc-like structures situated around luminous red galaxies. In this paper, we present a new redshift catalogue containing 29 lensed sources in SDSS confirmed through spectroscopic follow-up of candidate galaxy-galaxy lens systems. Included in this new sample are two of the brightest galaxies (r = 19.6 and 19.7) known at z ~= 2, a low metallicity (12 + log (O/H) ~= 8.0) extreme nebular line emitting galaxy at z = 1.43, and numerous systems for which detailed follow-up will be possible. The source redshifts span 0.9 < z < 2.5 (median redshift of 1.9), and their optical magnitudes are in the range 19.6 ≲ r ≲ 22.3. We present a brief source-by-source discussion of the spectroscopic properties extracted from our confirmatory spectra and discuss some initial science results. Preliminary lens modelling reveals average source magnifications of 5-10 times. With more than 50 gravitationally lensed z ≳ 1 galaxies now confirmed within SDSS, it will soon be possible for the first time to develop generalized conclusions from detailed spectroscopic studies of the brightest lensed systems at high redshift.},

@article{Conselice:2014fk,
	Abstract = {I present a comprehensive review of the evolution of galaxy structure in the Universe from the first galaxies currently observable at z ˜ 6 down to galaxies observable in the local Universe. Observed changes in galaxy structures reveal formation processes that only galaxy structural analyses can provide. This pedagogical review provides a detailed discussion of the major methods used to study galaxies morphologically and structurally, including the well-established visual method for morphology; S{\'e}rsic fitting to measure galaxy sizes and surface brightness profile shapes; and nonparametric structural methods [such as the concentration (C), asymmetry (A), clumpiness (S) (CAS) method and the Gini/M20 parameters, as well as newer structural indices]. These structural indices measure fundamental properties of galaxies, such as their scale, star-formation rate, and ongoing merger activity. Extensive observational results demonstrate how broad galaxy morphologies and structures change with time up to z ˜ 3, from small, compact and peculiar systems in the distant Universe to the formation of the Hubble sequence, dominated by spirals and ellipticals. Structural methods accurately identify galaxies in mergers and allow measurements of the merger history out to z ˜ 3. I depict properties and evolution of internal structures of galaxies, such as bulges, disks, bars, and at z>1 large star-forming clumps. I describe the structure and morphologies of host galaxies of active galactic nuclei and starbursts/submillimeter galaxies, along with how morphological galaxy quenching occurs. The role of environment in producing structural changes in galaxies over cosmic time is also discussed. Galaxy sizes can also change with time, with measured sizes up to a factor of 2-5 smaller at high redshift at a given stellar mass. I conclude with a discussion of how the evolving trends, in sizes, structures, and morphologies, reveal the formation mechanisms behind galaxies and provides a new and unique way to test theories of galaxy formation.},

	Abstract = {The 3D-HST and CANDELS programs have provided WFC3 and ACS spectroscopy and photometry over ≈900 arcmin2 in five fields: AEGIS, COSMOS, GOODS-North, GOODS-South, and the UKIDSS UDS field. All these fields have a wealth of publicly available imaging data sets in addition to the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data, which makes it possible to construct the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of objects over a wide wavelength range. In this paper we describe a photometric analysis of the CANDELS and 3D-HST HST imaging and the ancillary imaging data at wavelengths 0.3-8 mum. Objects were selected in the WFC3 near-IR bands, and their SEDs were determined by carefully taking the effects of the point-spread function in each observation into account. A total of 147 distinct imaging data sets were used in the analysis. The photometry is made available in the form of six catalogs: one for each field, as well as a master catalog containing all objects in the entire survey. We also provide derived data products: photometric redshifts, determined with the EAZY code, and stellar population parameters determined with the FAST code. We make all the imaging data that were used in the analysis available, including our reductions of the WFC3 imaging in all five fields. 3D-HST is a spectroscopic survey with the WFC3 and ACS grisms, and the photometric catalogs presented here constitute a necessary first step in the analysis of these grism data. All the data presented in this paper are available through the 3D-HST Web site (http://3dhst.research.yale.edu).},

	Abstract = {SN HFF14Tom is a Type Ia SN discovered at z=1.3457+/- 0.0001 behind the galaxy cluster Abell 2744 (z = 0.308). In a cosmology-independent analysis, we find that HFF14Tom is 0.77 $\pm$ 0.15 mag brighter than unlensed Type Ia SNe at similar redshift, implying a lensing magnification of {mu }{obs}=2.03+/- 0.29. This observed magnification provides a rare opportunity for a direct empirical test of galaxy cluster lens models. Here we test 17 lens models, 13 of which were generated before the SN magnification was known, qualifying as pure ``blind tests.'' The models are collectively fairly accurate: 8 of the models deliver median magnifications that are consistent with the measured mu to within 1sigma. However, there is a subtle systematic bias: the significant disagreements all involve models overpredicting the magnification. We evaluate possible causes for this mild bias, and find no single physical or methodological explanation to account for it. We do find that model accuracy can be improved to some extent with stringent quality cuts on multiply imaged systems, such as requiring that a large fraction have spectroscopic redshifts. In addition to testing model accuracies as we have done here, Type Ia SN magnifications could also be used as inputs for future lens models of Abell 2744 and other clusters, providing valuable constraints in regions where traditional strong- and weak-lensing information is unavailable.},

@article{Lefor:2013gf,
	Abstract = {Analysis of strong gravitational lensing depends on software analysis of observational data. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the behavior of strong gravitational lens modeling software with changes in redshift. Four different strong gravitational lens software modeling codes were directly compared (Lenstool / glafic, two light traces mass codes, and GRALE / PixeLens, two non-light traces mass codes) in the analysis of model data as well as analysis of the giant gravitational quasar SDSSJ1004+4112. A generalized model for time delay calculation shows that calculated time delay is proportional to $D_{d}D_{s}/D_{ds}$.The percent change in time delays calculated for each system at each redshift tested were compared with percent change in the value of $D_{d}D_{s}/D_{ds}$. A simple point mass model was tested with each code. Five models were used with a constant $z_{lens}$ and a varying $z_{source}$, and five models with a constant $z_{source}$ and a varying $z_{lens}$. The effects of changing geometry were similarly investigated for SDSSJ1004+4112. In general, the changes in time delay were of a similar magnitude and direction although, some calculated time delays varied by as much as 30 percent from changes in $D_{d}D_{s}/D_{ds}$. Changes in calculated mass for the point mass model with a constant $z_{source}$ were almost identical to changes in $D_{d}D_{s}/D_{ds}$ for three of the four codes tested. These data demonstrate the effect of changes in redshift on parameters calculated by each of the codes as compared to changes in $D_{d}D_{s}/D_{ds}$. The paucity of existing direct comparison studies of strong gravitational lensing supports the need for more studies of this kind. These results show that even small changes in redshift affects the calculation of time delay and mass, and that the effect on the calculations is dependent on the particular software used.},

@article{McLeod:2015nr,
	Abstract = {We present the results of a new search for galaxies at redshift z ~= 9 in the first two Hubble Frontier Fields with completed HST WFC3/IR and ACS imaging. To ensure robust photometric redshift solutions, and to minimize incompleteness, we confine our search to objects with H160 < 28.6 (AB mag), consider only image regions with an rms noise sigma160 > 30 mag (within a 0.5-arcsec diameter aperture), and insist on detections in both H160 and J140. The result is a survey covering an effective area (after accounting for magnification) of 10.9 arcmin2, which yields 12 galaxies at 8.4 < z < 9.5. Within the Abell-2744 cluster and parallel fields, we confirm the three brightest objects reported by Ishigaki et al., but recover only one of the four z > 8.4 sources reported by Zheng et al. In the MACSJ0416.1-240 cluster field, we report five objects, and explain why each of these eluded detection or classification as z ~= 9 galaxies in the published searches of the shallower CLASH data. Finally, we uncover four z ~= 9 galaxies from the MACSJ0416.1-240 parallel field. Based on the published magnification maps, we find that only one of these 12 galaxies is likely boosted by more than a factor of 2 by gravitational lensing. Consequently, we are able to perform a fairly straightforward reanalysis of the normalization of the z ~= 9 UV galaxy luminosity function as explored previously in the HUDF12 programme. We conclude that the new data strengthen the evidence for a continued smooth decline in UV luminosity density (and hence star formation rate density) from z ~= 8 to 9, contrary to recent reports of a marked drop-off at these redshifts. This provides further support for the scenario in which early galaxy evolution is sufficiently extended to explain cosmic reionization.},

	Abstract = {We present aperture-matched point-spread function (PSF)-corrected BVi'z'JH photometry and Bayesian photometric redshifts (BPZ) for objects detected in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UDF), 8042 of which are detected at the 10 sigma level (e.g., i'<29.01 or z'<28.43). Most of our objects are defined identically to those in the public STScI catalogs, enabling a straightforward object-by-object comparison. We have combined detections from i', z', J+H, and B+V+i'+z' images into a single comprehensive segmentation map. Using a new program called SExSeg, we are able to force this segmentation map into SExtractor for photometric analysis. The resulting photometry is corrected for the wider NIC3 PSFs using our ColorPro software. We also correct for the ACS z'-band PSF halo. Offsets are applied to our NIC3 magnitudes, which are found to be too faint relative to the ACS fluxes. Based on BPZ spectral energy distribution (SED) fits to objects of known spectroscopic redshift, we derived corrections of -0.30+/-0.03 mag in J and -0.18+/-0.04 mag in H. Our offsets appear to be supported by a recent recalibration of the UDF NIC3 images combined with nonlinearity measured in NICMOS itself. The UDF reveals a large population of faint blue galaxies (presumably young starbursts), bluer than those observed in the original Hubble Deep Fields. To accommodate these galaxies, we have added two new starburst templates to the SED library used in previous BPZ papers. The resulting photometric redshifts are accurate to within 0.04(1+zspec) out to z<6. Our BPZ results include a full redshift probability distribution for each galaxy. By adding these distributions, we obtain the redshift probability histogram for galaxies in the UDF. Median redshifts are also provided for different magnitude-limited samples. Finally, we measure galaxy morphology, including S{\'e}rsic index and asymmetry. Simulations allow us to quantify the reliability of our morphological results. Our full catalog, along with our software packages SExSeg and ColorPro, is available from our ACS Web site.},

@article{Gladders:2000kq,
	Abstract = {Numerous methods for finding clusters at moderate to high redshifts have been proposed in recent years, at wavelengths ranging from radio to X-rays. In this paper we describe a new method for detecting clusters in two-band optical/near-IR imaging data. The method relies upon the observation that all rich clusters, at all redshifts observed so far, appear to have a red sequence of early-type galaxies. The emerging picture is that all rich clusters contain a core population of passively evolving elliptical galaxies that are coeval and formed at high redshifts. The proposed search method exploits this strong empirical fact by using the red sequence as a direct indicator of overdensity. The fundamental advantage of this approach is that with appropriate filters, cluster elliptical galaxies at a given redshift are redder than all normal galaxies at lower redshifts. A simple color cut thus virtually eliminates all foreground contamination, even at significant redshifts. In this paper, one of a series of two, we describe the underlying assumptions and basic techniques of the method in detail and contrast the method with those used by other authors. We provide a brief demonstration of the effectiveness of the technique using a real photometric sample with redshift data, and from this we conclude that the method offers a powerful yet simple way of identify galaxy clusters. We find that the method can reliably detect structures to masses as small as groups with velocity dispersions of only ~300 km s-1, with redshifts for all detected structures estimated to an accuracy of ~10%.},

	Abstract = {We introduce a stable, well tested Python implementation of the affine-invariant ensemble sampler for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) proposed by Goodman & Weare (2010). The code is open source and has already been used in several published projects in the astrophysics literature. The algorithm behind emcee has several advantages over traditional MCMC sampling methods and it has excellent performance as measured by the autocorrelation time (or function calls per independent sample). One major advantage of the algorithm is that it requires hand-tuning of only 1 or 2 parameters compared to ˜N2 for a traditional algorithm in an N-dimensional parameter space. In this document, we describe the algorithm and the details of our implementation. Exploiting the parallelism of the ensemble method, emcee permits any user to take advantage of multiple CPU cores without extra  effort. The code is available online at http://dan.iel.fm/emcee under the GNU General Public License v2.},

	Abstract = {We describe a method to estimate the mass distribution of a gravitational lens and the position of the sources from combined strong and weak lensing data. The algorithm combines weak and strong lensing data in a unified way producing a solution which is valid in both the weak and the strong lensing regimes. The method is non-parametric, allowing the mass to be located anywhere in the field of view. We study how the solution depends on the choice of basis used to represent the mass distribution. We find that combining weak and strong lensing information has two major advantages: it alleviates the need for priors and/or regularization schemes for the intrinsic size of the background galaxies (this assumption was needed in previous strong lensing algorithms) and it reduces (although does not remove) biases in the recovered mass in the outer regions where the strong lensing data are less sensitive. The code is implemented into a software package called Weak & Strong Lensing Analysis Package (WSLAP) which is publicly available at http://darwin.cfa.harvard.edu/SLAP/.},

	Abstract = {We revisit the issue of non-parametric gravitational lens reconstruction and present a new method to obtain the cluster mass distribution using strong lensing data without using any prior information on the underlying mass. The method relies on the decomposition of the lens plane into individual cells. We show how the problem in this approximation can be expressed as a system of linear equations for which a solution can be found. Moreover, we propose to include information about the null space. That is, we make use of the pixels in which we know there are no arcs above the sky noise. The only prior information is an estimation of the physical size of the sources. No priors on the luminosity of the cluster or shape of the haloes are needed, making the results very robust. In order to test the accuracy and bias of the method we make use of simulated strong lensing data. We find that the method reproduces accurately both the lens mass and source positions and provides error estimates.},

	Abstract = {We present a striking new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observation of the rich cluster Abell 2218 taken with the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2. HST's restored image quality reveals a sizable number of gravitationally lensed features in this cluster, significantly more than bad been identified by using ground-based telescopes. The brightest arcs are resolved by HST and show internal features that enable us to identify multiply imaged examples, confirming and improving the mass models of the cluster determined from ground-based observations. Although weak lensing has been detected statistically in this and other clusters from ground- based data, the superlative resolution of HST enables us to individually identify weakly distorted images more reliably than hitherto, with important consequences for their redshift determination. Using an improved mass model for the cluster calibrated with available spectroscopy for the brightest arcs, we demonstrate how inversion of the lensing model can be used to yield the redshift distribution of ~80 faint arclets to R ~ 25. We present a new formalism for estimating the uncertainties in this inversion method and review prospects for interpreting our results and verifying the predicted redshifts.},

@article{Meneghetti:2010mi,
	Abstract = {Context. Strong lensing is one of the most direct probes of mass distribution in the inner regions of galaxy clusters. It can be used to constrain the density profiles and to measure the mass of the lenses. Moreover, the abundance of strong lensing events can be used to constrain structure formation and cosmological parameters through the so-called ``arc-statistics'' approach. However, several issues related to the use of strong lensing clusters in cosmological applications are still controversial, leading to the suspicion that several biases may affect this very peculiar class of objects.  Aims: With this study we aim a better understanding of the properties of galaxy clusters that can potentially act as strong lenses.  Methods: We do so by investigating the properties of a large sample of galaxy clusters extracted from the N-body/hydrodynamical simulation MareNostrum Universe. We perform ray-tracing simulations with each of them and identify those objects capable of producing strong lensing effects. We explore the correlation between the cross section for lensing and many properties of clusters, such as mass, three-dimensional and projected shapes, their concentrations, the X-ray luminosity, and the dynamical activity.  Results: We quantify the minimal cluster mass required for producing both multiple images and large distortions. While we do not measure a significant excess of triaxiality in strong lensing clusters, we find that the probability of strong alignments between the major axes of the lenses and the line of sight is a growing function of the lensing cross section. In projection, the strong lenses appear rounder within R200, but we find that their cores tend to be more elliptical as the lensing cross section increases. As a result of the orientation bias, we also find that the cluster concentrations estimated from the projected density profiles tend to be biased high. The X-ray luminosity of strong lensing clusters tend to be higher than for normal lenses of similar mass and redshift. This is particularly significant for the least massive lenses. Finally, we find that the strongest lenses generally exhibit an excess of kinetic energy within the virial radius, thus indicating that they are more dynamically active than the usual clusters.  Conclusions: We conclude that strong lensing clusters are a very peculiar class of objects, affected by many selection biases that need to be properly modeled when using them to study the inner structure of galaxy clusters or to constrain the cosmological parameters.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We present a newly developed code that allows simulations of optical observations of galaxy fields with a variety of instruments. The code incorporates gravitational lensing effects and is targeted at simulating lensing by galaxy clusters. Our goal is to create the tools required for comparing theoretical expectations with observations to better understand of how observational noise affects lensing applications such as mass estimates, studies of the internal properties of galaxy clusters and arc statistics.  Methods: Starting from a set of input parameters, characterizing both the instruments and the observational conditions, the simulator provides a virtual observation of a patch of the sky. It includes several sources of noise such as photon-noise, sky background, seeing, and instrumental noise. Ray tracing through simulated mass distributions accounts for gravitational lensing. Source morphologies are realistically simulated based on shapelet decompositions of galaxy images retrieved from the GOODS-ACS archive. According to their morphological class, spectral-energy-distributions are assigned to the source galaxies to reproduce observations of each galaxy in arbitrary photometric bands. Results: We illustrate our techniques showing virtual observations of a galaxy-cluster core as it would be observed with the space telescope DUNE, which was recently proposed to ESA within its ``Cosmic vision'' program. We analyze the simulated images using methods applicable to real observations and measure the properties of gravitational arcs. In particular, we focus on the determination of their length, width, and curvature radius.  Conclusions: We find that arc properties strongly depend on several properties of the sources. In particular, our results show that compact, faint, or low surface-brightness galaxies that are barely detectable are more easily distorted as arcs with large length-to-width ratios. We conclude that realistic lensing simulations can be obtained with the method proposed here. They will be essential for evaluating and improving the analysis techniques currently used for cosmological interpretations of cluster lensing.},

	Abstract = {We use high-resolution N-body simulations to study the equilibrium density profiles of dark matter halos in hierarchically clustering universes. We find that all such profiles have the same shape, independent of the halo mass, the initial density fluctuation spectrum, and the values of the cosmological parameters. Spherically averaged equilibrium profiles are well fitted over two decades in radius by a simple formula originally proposed to describe the structure of galaxy clusters in a cold dark matter universe. In any particular cosmology, the two scale parameters of the fit, the halo mass and its characteristic density, are strongly correlated. Low-mass halos are significantly denser than more massive systems, a correlation that reflects the higher collapse redshift of small halos. The characteristic density of an equilibrium halo is proportional to the density of the universe at the time it was assembled. A suitable definition of this assembly time allows the same proportionality constant to be used for all the cosmologies that we have tested. We compare our results with previous work on halo density profiles and show that there is good agreement. We also provide a step-by-step analytic procedure, based on the Press-Schechter formalism, that allows accurate equilibrium profiles to be calculated as a function of mass in any hierarchical model.},

	Abstract = {Strong gravitational lensing is a powerful tool that can be used to probe the matter distribution in the cores of massive dark matter haloes. Recent and ongoing analyses of galaxy cluster surveys - such as the Massive Cluster Survey (MACS), the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS), the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), the Sloan Giant Arcs Survey (SGAS), the Cluster Lensing and Supernova Survey with Hubble (CLASH) and the Local Cluster Substructure Survey (LoCuSS) - have addressed the question of the nature of the dark matter distribution in clusters. Using N-body simulations of cold dark matter haloes, it is consistently found that haloes should be characterized by a concentration-mass relation, which decreases monotonically with halo mass, and that they should be populated by a large amount of substructures, representing the cores of accreted progenitor halos. It is important for our understanding of dark matter that we test these predictions. We present MOKA, a new algorithm for simulating the gravitational lensing signal from cluster-sized haloes. It implements the most recent results from numerical simulations to create realistic cluster-scale lenses with properties independent of numerical resolution. We perform systematic studies of the strong lensing cross-section as a function of halo structures. We find that the strong lensing cross-sections depend most strongly on the concentration and on the inner slope of the density profile of a halo, followed in order of importance by halo triaxiality and the presence of a bright central galaxy.},

	Abstract = {We use the Millennium Simulation, a 10 billion particle simulation of the growth of cosmic structure, to construct a new model of galaxy clustering. We adopt a methodology that falls midway between the traditional semi-analytic approach and the halo occupation distribution (HOD) approach. In our model, we adopt the positions and velocities of the galaxies that are predicted by following the orbits and merging histories of the substructures in the simulation. Rather than using star formation and feedback `recipes' to specify the physical properties of the galaxies, we adopt parametrized functions to relate these properties to the quantity Minfall, defined as the mass of the halo at the epoch when the galaxy was last the central dominant object in its own halo. We test whether these parametrized relations allow us to recover the basic statistical properties of galaxies in the semi-analytic catalogues, including the luminosity function, the stellar mass function and the shape and amplitude of the two-point correlation function evaluated in different stellar mass and luminosity ranges. We then use our model to interpret recent measurements of these quantities from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data. We derive relations between the luminosities and the stellar masses of galaxies in the local Universe and their host halo masses. Our results are in excellent agreement with recent determinations of these relations by Mandelbaum et al. using galaxy-galaxy weak lensing measurements from the SDSS.},

	Abstract = {We present a statistical analysis of a sample of 20 strong lensing clusters drawn from the Local Cluster Substructure Survey, based on high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the cluster cores and follow-up spectroscopic observations using the Keck-I telescope. We use detailed parametrized models of the mass distribution in the cluster cores, to measure the total cluster mass and fraction of that mass associated with substructures within R <= 250kpc. These measurements are compared with the distribution of baryons in the cores, as traced by the old stellar populations and the X-ray emitting intracluster medium. Our main results include: (i) the distribution of Einstein radii is lognormal, with a peak and 1sigma width of <log10thetaE(z = 2)> = 1.16 +/- 0.28; (ii) we detect an X-ray/lensing mass discrepancy of <MSL/MX> = 1.3 at 3sigma significance - clusters with larger substructure fractions displaying greater mass discrepancies, and thus greater departures from hydrostatic equilibrium and (iii) cluster substructure fraction is also correlated with the slope of the gas density profile on small scales, implying a connection between cluster-cluster mergers and gas cooling. Overall our results are consistent with the view that cluster-cluster mergers play a prominent role in shaping the properties of cluster cores, in particular causing departures from hydrostatic equilibrium, and possibly disturbing cool cores. Our results do not support recent claims that large Einstein radius clusters present a challenge to the cold dark matter paradigm.},

@article{Richard:2007rr,
	Abstract = {We have carried out an extensive spectroscopic survey with the Keck and VLT telescopes, targeting lensed galaxies in the background of the massive cluster Abell 68. Spectroscopic measurements are obtained for 26 lensed images, including a distant galaxy at z=5.4. Redshifts have been determined for 5 out of 7 multiple-image systems. Through a careful modeling of the mass distribution in the strongly lensed regime, we derive a mass estimate of 5.3×1014 Msolar within 500 kpc. Our mass model is then used to constrain the redshift distribution of the remaining multiply imaged and singly imaged sources. This enables us to examine the physical properties for a subsample of 7 Lyalpha emitters at 1.7<~z<~5.5, whose unlensed luminosities of ~=1041 ergs s-1 are fainter than similar objects found in blank fields. Of particular interest is an extended Lyalpha emission region surrounding a highly magnified source at z=2.6, detected in VIMOS integral field spectroscopy data. The physical scale of the most distant lensed source at z=5.4 is very small (<300 pc), similar to the lensed z~5.6 emitter reported by Ellis et al. in Abell 2218. New photometric data available for Abell 2218 allow for a direct comparison between these two unique objects. Our survey illustrates the practicality of using lensing clusters to probe the faint end of the z~2-5 Lyalpha luminosity function in a manner that is complementary to blank-field narrowband surveys.  Data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.

	Abstract = {The gravitational potential of clusters of galaxies acts as a cosmic telescope allowing us to find and study galaxies at fainter limits than otherwise possible and thus probe closer to the epoch of formation of the first galaxies. We use the Bullet cluster 1E0657 - 56 (z = 0.296) as a case study, because its high mass and merging configuration makes it one of the most efficient cosmic telescopes we know. We develop a new algorithm to reconstruct the gravitational potential of the Bullet cluster based on a non-uniform adaptive grid, combining strong and weak gravitational lensing data derived from deep Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys F606W-F775W-F850LP and ground-based imaging. We exploit this improved mass map to study z ~ 5-6 Lyman break galaxies (LBGs), which we detect as dropouts. One of the LBGs is multiply imaged, providing a geometric confirmation of its high redshift, and is used to further improve our mass model. We quantify the uncertainties in the magnification map reconstruction in the intrinsic source luminosity, and in the volume surveyed, and show that they are negligible compared to sample variance when determining the luminosity function of high-redshift galaxies. With shallower and comparable magnitude limits to Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) and Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS), the Bullet cluster observations, after correcting for magnification, probe deeper into the luminosity function of the high-redshift galaxies than GOODS and only slightly shallower than HUDF. We conclude that accurately focused cosmic telescopes are the most efficient way to sample the bright end of the luminosity function of high-redshift galaxies and---in case they are multiply imaged---confirm their redshifts.  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are associated with programs # GO10200, GO10863, and GO11099.},

	Abstract = {We present the first strong-lensing (SL) analysis of the galaxy cluster ACT-CL J0102-4915 (El Gordo), in recent HST/ACS images, revealing a prominent strong lens at a redshift of z = 0.87. This finding adds to the already-established unique properties of El Gordo: it is the most massive, hot, X-ray luminous, and bright Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect cluster at z >~ 0.6, and the only "bullet"-like merging cluster known at these redshifts. The lens consists of two merging massive clumps, where, for a source redshift of zs ~ 2, each clump exhibits only a small, separate critical area, with a total area of 0.69 $\pm$ 0.11squ' over the two clumps. For a higher source redshift, zs ~ 4, the critical curves of the two clumps merge together into one bigger and very elongated lens (axis ratio ~= 5.5), enclosing an effective area of 1.44 $\pm$ 0.22squ'. The critical curves continue expanding with increasing redshift so that for high-redshift sources (zs >~ 9) they enclose an area of ~1.91 $\pm$ 0.30squ' (effective theta e  ~= 46.''8 $\pm$ 3.''7) and a mass of 6.09 $\pm$ 1.04 × 1014 M &sun;. According to our model, the area of high magnification (mu > 10) for such high-redshift sources is sime1.2squ', and the area with mu > 5 is sime2.3squ', making El Gordo a compelling target for studying the high-redshift universe. We obtain a strong lower limit on the total mass of El Gordo, >~ 1.7 × 1015 M &sun; from the SL regime alone, suggesting a total mass of roughly M 200 ~ 2.3 × 1015 M &sun;. Our results should be revisited when additional spectroscopic and HST imaging data are available.},

	Abstract = {We present results from a comprehensive lensing analysis in Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data of the complete Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble cluster sample. We identify previously undiscovered multiple images, allowing improved or first constraints on the cluster inner mass distributions and profiles. We combine these strong lensing constraints with weak lensing shape measurements within the HST field of view (FOV) to jointly constrain the mass distributions. The analysis is performed in two different common parameterizations (one adopts light-traces-mass for both galaxies and dark matter while the other adopts an analytical, elliptical Navarro-Frenk-White form for the dark matter) to provide a better assessment of the underlying systematics---which is most important for deep, cluster-lensing surveys, especially when studying magnified high-redshift objects. We find that the typical (median), relative systematic differences throughout the central FOV are ~40% in the (dimensionless) mass density, kappa, and ~20% in the magnification, mu. We show maps of these differences for each cluster, as well as the mass distributions, critical curves, and two-dimensional (2D)-integrated mass profiles. For the Einstein radii (zs = 2) we find that all typically agree within 10% between the two models, and Einstein masses agree, typically, within ~15%. At larger radii, the total projected, 2D-integrated mass profiles of the two models, within r ~ 2', differ by ~30%. Stacking the surface-density profiles of the sample from the two methods together, we obtain an average slope of dlog (Sigma)/dlog (r) ~ -0.64 $\pm$ 0.1, in the radial range [5350] kpc. Last, we also characterize the behavior of the average magnification, surface density, and shear differences between the two models as a function of both the radius from the center and the best-fit values of these quantities. All mass models and magnification maps are made publicly available for the community.},

	Abstract = {We examine Abell 1689 non-parametrically, combining strongly lensed Hubble Space Telescope images and weak distortions from wider field Subaru imaging. Our model incorporates member galaxies to improve the lens solution. By adding luminosity-scaled member galaxy deflections to our smooth grid, we can derive meaningful solutions with sufficient accuracy to permit the identification of our own strongly lensed images, so our model becomes self-consistent. We identify 11 new multiply lensed system candidates and clarify previously ambiguous cases, in the deepest optical and near-infrared data to date from Hubble and Subaru. Our improved spatial resolution brings up new features not seen when the weak and strong lensing effects are used separately, including clumps and filamentary dark matter around the main halo. Our treatment means we can obtain an objective mass ratio between the cluster and galaxy components. We find a typical mass-to-light ratios of M/LB = 21 $\pm$ 14 inside the r < 1 arcmin region. Our model independence means we can objectively evaluate the competitiveness of stacking cluster lenses for defining the geometric lensing-distance-redshift relation in a model-independent way.},

@article{Madau:2014qd,
	Abstract = {Over the past two decades, an avalanche of new data from multiwavelength imaging and spectroscopic surveys has revolutionized our view of galaxy formation and evolution. Here we review the range of complementary techniques and theoretical tools that allow astronomers to map the cosmic history of star formation, heavy element production, and reionization of the Universe from the cosmic ``dark ages'' to the present epoch. A consistent picture is emerging, whereby the star-formation rate density peaked approximately 3.5 Gyr after the Big Bang, at z≈1.9, and declined exponentially at later times, with an e-folding timescale of 3.9 Gyr. Half of the stellar mass observed today was formed before a redshift z = 1.3. About 25% formed before the peak of the cosmic star-formation rate density, and another 25% formed after z = 0.7. Less than ˜1% of today's stars formed during the epoch of reionization. Under the assumption of a universal initial mass function, the global stellar mass density inferred at any epoch matches reasonably well the time integral of all the preceding star-formation activity. The comoving rates of star formation and central black hole accretion follow a similar rise and fall, offering evidence for coevolution of black holes and their host galaxies. The rise of the mean metallicity of the Universe to about 0.001 solar by z = 6, one Gyr after the Big Bang, appears to have been accompanied by the production of fewer than ten hydrogen Lyman-continuum photons per baryon, a rather tight budget for cosmological reionization.},

	Abstract = {We report on the first results of an imaging survey to detect strong gravitational lensing targeting the richest clusters selected from the photometric data of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) with follow-up deep imaging observations from the Wisconsin-Indiana-Yale NOAO (WIYN) 3.5 m telescope and the University of Hawaii 88 inch telescope (UH88). The clusters are selected from an area of 8000 deg2 using the red cluster sequence technique and span the redshift range 0.1 lsim z lsim 0.6, corresponding to a comoving cosmological volume of ~2 Gpc3. Our imaging survey thus targets a volume more than an order of magnitude larger than any previous search. A total of 240 clusters were imaged of which 141 had sub-arcsecond image quality. Our survey has uncovered 16 new lensing clusters with definite giant arcs, an additional 12 systems for which the lensing interpretation is very likely, and 9 possible lenses which contain shorter arclets or candidate arcs which are less certain and will require further observations to confirm their lensing origin. Among these new systems are several of the most dramatic examples of strong gravitational lensing ever discovered, with multiple bright arcs at large angular separation.

	Abstract = {The incidence of giant arcs due to strong-lensing clusters of galaxies is known to be discrepant with current theoretical expectations. This result derives from a comparison of several cluster samples with predictions in the framework of the currently favored LambdaCDM cosmology, and one possible explanation for the discrepancy is that this cosmological model is not correct. In this paper we discuss the incidence of giant arcs in the Red-Sequence Cluster Survey (RCS), which again shows significant disagreement with theoretical predictions. We briefly describe a total of eight strong-lens systems, seven of which are discussed here for the first time. Based on the details of these systems, in particular on the ratio of single- to multiple-arc systems, we argue that it may be possible to explain this discrepancy in the currently favored cosmology by modifying the details of the lenses themselves. Specifically, the high incidence of multiple-arc systems and their overall high redshift suggests that a subpopulation of the global cluster population is responsible for much of the observed lensing. The lack of lensing clusters at z<0.64 in the RCS indicates that a property associated with clusters at early times results in the boosted lensing cross sections; likely, a combination of ellipticity and elongation along the line of sight, substructure, and changes in the cluster-mass profiles is responsible. Cluster mass, which should evolve to globally higher values toward lower redshifts, is clearly not the most significant consideration for the formation of giant arcs.  Based on observations collected at the Baade 6.5 m telescope, the CFHT 3.6 m telescope, and the CTIO 4 m telescope.},

@article{Wambsganss:2004vn,
	Abstract = {The frequency of giant arcs-highly distorted and strongly gravitationally lensed background galaxies-is a powerful test for cosmological models. Previous comparisons of arc statistics for the currently favored concordance cosmological model (lambda cold dark matter [LCDM]) with observations have shown an apparently large discrepancy in underpredicting cluster arcs. We present new ray-shooting results, based on a high-resolution (10243 particles in a 320 h-1 Mpc box) large-scale structure simulation normalized to the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) observations. We follow light rays through a pseudo-three-dimensional matter distribution approximated by up to 38 lens planes and evaluate the occurrence of arcs for various source redshifts. We find that the frequency of strongly lensed background galaxies is a steep function of source redshift: the optical depth for giant arcs increases by a factor of 5 when background sources are moved from redshift zs=1.0 to 1.5. This is a consequence of a small decrease of the critical surface mass density for lensing, combined with the very steep cluster mass function at the high-mass end plus a modest contribution from secondary lens planes. Our results are consistent with those of Bartelmann et al. if we-as they did-restrict all sources to be at zs=1. If we allow sources extending to or beyond zs>=1.5, the apparent discrepancy vanishes: the frequency of arcs increases by about a factor of 10 as compared to previous estimates, and results in roughly one arc per 20 deg2 over the sky, in good agreement with the observed frequency of arcs.},

	Abstract = {The first half of this paper explores the origin of systematic biases in the measurement of weak gravitational lensing. Compared to previous work, we expand the investigation of point spread function instability and fold in for the first time the effects of non-idealities in electronic imaging detectors and imperfect galaxy shape measurement algorithms. Together, these now explain the additive {A}(l) and multiplicative {M}(l) systematics typically reported in current lensing measurements. We find that overall performance is driven by a product of a telescope/camera's absolute performance, and our knowledge about its performance.  The second half of this paper propagates any residual shear measurement biases through to their effect on cosmological parameter constraints. Fully exploiting the statistical power of Stage IV weak lensing surveys will require additive biases overline{{A}}≲ 1.8× 10^{-12} and multiplicative biases overline{{M}}≲ 4.0× 10^{-3}. These can be allocated between individual budgets in hardware, calibration data and software, using results from the first half of the paper.  If instrumentation is stable and well calibrated, we find extant shear measurement software from Gravitational Lensing Accuracy Testing 2010 (GREAT10) already meet requirements on galaxies detected at signal-to-noise ratio = 40. Averaging over a population of galaxies with a realistic distribution of sizes, it also meets requirements for a 2D cosmic shear analysis from space. If used on fainter galaxies or for 3D cosmic shear tomography, existing algorithms would need calibration on simulations to avoid introducing bias at a level similar to the statistical error. Requirements on hardware and calibration data are discussed in more detail in a companion paper. Our analysis is intentionally general, but is specifically being used to drive the hardware and ground segment performance budget for the design of the European Space Agency's recently selected Euclid mission.},

	Abstract = {We report weak-lensing masses for 51 of the most X-ray luminous galaxy clusters known. This cluster sample, introduced earlier in this series of papers, spans redshifts 0.15 ≲ zcl ≲ 0.7, and is well suited to calibrate mass proxies for current cluster cosmology experiments. Cluster masses are measured with a standard `colour-cut' lensing method from three-filter photometry of each field. Additionally, for 27 cluster fields with at least five-filter photometry, we measure high-accuracy masses using a new method that exploits all information available in the photometric redshift posterior probability distributions of individual galaxies. Using simulations based on the COSMOS-30 catalogue, we demonstrate control of systematic biases in the mean mass of the sample with this method, from photometric redshift biases and associated uncertainties, to better than 3 per cent. In contrast, we show that the use of single-point estimators in place of the full photometric redshift posterior distributions can lead to significant redshift-dependent biases on cluster masses. The performance of our new photometric redshift-based method allows us to calibrate `colour-cut' masses for all 51 clusters in the present sample to a total systematic uncertainty of ≈7 per cent on the mean mass, a level sufficient to significantly improve current cosmology constraints from galaxy clusters. Our results bode well for future cosmological studies of clusters, potentially reducing the need for exhaustive spectroscopic calibration surveys as compared to other techniques, when deep, multifilter optical and near-IR imaging surveys are coupled with robust photometric redshift methods.},

	Abstract = {The measurement of cosmic shear using weak gravitational lensing is a challenging task that involves a number of complicated procedures. We study in detail the systematic errors in the measurement of weak-lensing Minkowski Functionals (MFs). Specifically, we focus on systematics associated with galaxy shape measurements, photometric redshift errors, and shear calibration correction. We first generate mock weak-lensing catalogs that directly incorporate the actual observational characteristics of the Canada-France-Hawaii Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS). We then perform a Fisher analysis using the large set of mock catalogs for various cosmological models. We find that the statistical error associated with the observational effects degrades the cosmological parameter constraints by a factor of a few. The Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey with a sky coverage of ~1400 deg2 will constrain the dark energy equation of the state parameter with an error of Deltaw 0 ~ 0.25 by the lensing MFs alone, but biases induced by the systematics can be comparable to the 1sigma error. We conclude that the lensing MFs are powerful statistics beyond the two-point statistics only if well-calibrated measurement of both the redshifts and the shapes of source galaxies is performed. Finally, we analyze the CFHTLenS data to explore the ability of the MFs to break degeneracies between a few cosmological parameters. Using a combined analysis of the MFs and the shear correlation function, we derive the matter density \Omega _m0 = 0.256+/- ^{0.054}_{0.046}.},

	Abstract = {We present adaptive optics-assisted integral field spectroscopy around the Halpha or Hbeta lines of 12 gravitationally lensed galaxies obtained with VLT/SINFONI, Keck/OSIRIS and Gemini/NIFS. We combine these data with previous observations and investigate the dynamics and star formation properties of 17 lensed galaxies at 1 < z < 4. Thanks to gravitational magnification of 1.4-90 times by foreground clusters, effective spatial resolutions of 40-700 pc are achieved. The magnification also allows us to probe lower star formation rates (SFRs) and stellar masses than unlensed samples; our target galaxies feature dust-corrected SFRs derived from Halpha or Hbeta emission of ˜0.8-40 M&sun; yr-1, and stellar masses M* ˜ 4 × 108-6 × 1010 M&sun;. All of the galaxies show velocity gradients, with 59 per cent consistent with being rotating discs and a likely merger fraction of 29 per cent, with the remaining 12 per cent classed as `undetermined'. We extract 50 star-forming clumps with sizes in the range 60 pc-1 kpc from the Halpha (or Hbeta) maps, and find that their surface brightnesses, Sigmaclump and their characteristic luminosities, L0, evolve to higher luminosities with redshift. We show that this evolution can be described by fragmentation on larger scales in gas-rich discs, and is likely to be driven by evolving gas fractions.},

	Abstract = {We present Halpha integral field spectroscopy of well-resolved, UV/optically selected z~2 star-forming galaxies as part of the SINS survey with SINFONI on the ESO VLT. Our laser guide star adaptive optics and good seeing data show the presence of turbulent rotating star-forming outer rings/disks, plus central bulge/inner disk components, whose mass fractions relative to the total dynamical mass appear to scale with the [N II]/Halpha flux ratio and the star formation age. We propose that the buildup of the central disks and bulges of massive galaxies at z~2 can be driven by the early secular evolution of gas-rich proto-disks. High-redshift disks exhibit large random motions. This turbulence may in part be stirred up by the release of gravitational energy in the rapid ``cold'' accretion flows along the filaments of the cosmic web. As a result, dynamical friction and viscous processes proceed on a timescale of <1 Gyr, at least an order of magnitude faster than in z~0 disk galaxies. Early secular evolution thus drives gas and stars into the central regions and can build up exponential disks and massive bulges, even without major mergers. Secular evolution along with increased efficiency of star formation at high surface densities may also help to account for the short timescales of the stellar buildup observed in massive galaxies at z~2.

@article{Guo:2015zl,
	Abstract = {Although giant clumps of stars are thought to be crucial to galaxy formation and evolution, the most basic demographics of clumps are still uncertain, mainly because the definition of clumps has not been thoroughly discussed. In this paper, we carry out a study of the basic demographics of clumps in star-forming galaxies at 0.5 < z < 3, using our proposed physical definition that UV-bright clumps are discrete star-forming regions that individually contribute more than 8% of the rest-frame UV light of their galaxies. Clumps defined this way are significantly brighter than the H II regions of nearby large spiral galaxies, either individually or blended, when physical spatial resolution and cosmological dimming are considered. Under this definition, we measure the fraction of star-forming galaxies that have at least one off-center clump (f clumpy) and the contributions of clumps to the rest-frame UV light and star formation rate (SFR) of star-forming galaxies in the CANDELS/GOODS-S and UDS fields, where our mass-complete sample consists of 3239 galaxies with axial ratio q > 0.5. The redshift evolution of f clumpy changes with the stellar mass (M *) of the galaxies. Low-mass (log (M */M ☉) < 9.8) galaxies keep an almost constant f clumpy of ~60% from z ~ 3 to z ~ 0.5. Intermediate-mass and massive galaxies drop their f clumpy from 55% at z ~ 3 to 40% and 15%, respectively, at z ~ 0.5. We find that (1) the trend of disk stabilization predicted by violent disk instability matches the f clumpy trend of massive galaxies; (2) minor mergers are a viable explanation of the f clumpy trend of intermediate-mass galaxies at z < 1.5, given a realistic observability timescale; and (3) major mergers are unlikely responsible for the f clumpy trend in all masses at z < 1.5. The clump contribution to the rest-frame UV light of star-forming galaxies shows a broad peak around galaxies with log (M */M ☉) ~ 10.5 at all redshifts. The clump contribution in the intermediate-mass and massive galaxies is possibly linked to the molecular gas fraction of the galaxies. The clump contribution to the SFR of star-forming galaxies, generally around 4%-10%, also shows dependence on the galaxy M *, but for a given galaxy M *, its dependence on the redshift is mild.},

	Abstract = {We report the detection of color gradients in six massive (stellar mass (M star) > 1010 M &sun;) and passively evolving (specific star formation rate <10-11 yr-1) galaxies at redshift 1.3 < z < 2.5 identified in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field using ultra-deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys and WFC3/IR images. After carefully matching the different point-spread functions, we obtain color maps and multi-band optical/near-IR photometry (BVizYJH) in concentric annuli, from the smallest resolved radial distance (≈1.7 kpc) up to several times the H-band effective radius. We find that the inner regions of these galaxies have redder rest-frame UV-optical colors (U - V, U - B, and B - V) than the outer parts. The slopes of the color gradient have no obvious dependence on the redshift and on the stellar mass of the galaxies. They do mildly depend, however, on the overall dust obscuration (E(B - V)) and rest-frame (U - V) color, with more obscured or redder galaxies having steeper color gradients. The z ~ 2 color gradients are also steeper than those of local early-type ones. The gradient of a single parameter (age, extinction, or metallicity) cannot fully explain the observed color gradients. Fitting the spatially resolved HST seven-band photometry to stellar population synthesis models, we find that, regardless of assumptions on the metallicity gradient, the redder inner regions of the galaxies have slightly higher dust obscuration than the bluer outer regions, implying that dust partly contributes to the observed color gradients, although the magnitude depends on the assumed extinction law. Due to the age-metallicity degeneracy, the derived age gradient depends on the assumptions for the metallicity gradient. We discuss the implications of a number of assumptions for metallicity gradients on the formation and evolution of these galaxies. We find that the evolution of the mass-size relationship from z ~ 2 to the present cannot be driven by in situ extended star formation, which implies that accretion or merger is mostly responsible for the growth of their stellar mass and size. The lack of a correlation between the strength of the color gradient and the stellar mass argues against the metallicity gradient predicted by the monolithic-collapse scenario, which would require significant major mergers to evolve into the one observed at the present.},

	Abstract = {We present deep and high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope NIC2 F160W imaging at 1.6 mum of six z ~ 2 star-forming galaxies with existing near-infrared integral field spectroscopy from SINFONI at the Very Large Telescope. The unique combination of rest-frame optical imaging and nebular emission-line maps provides simultaneous insight into morphologies and dynamical properties. The overall rest-frame optical emission of the galaxies is characterized by shallow profiles in general (S{\'e}rsic index n < 1), with median effective radii of R e ~ 5 kpc. The morphologies are significantly clumpy and irregular, which we quantify through a non-parametric morphological approach, estimating the Gini (G), multiplicity (Psi), and M 20 coefficients. The estimated strength of the rest-frame optical emission lines in the F160W bandpass indicates that the observed structure is not dominated by the morphology of line-emitting gas, and must reflect the underlying stellar mass distribution of the galaxies. The sizes and structural parameters in the rest-frame optical continuum and Halpha emission reveal no significant differences, suggesting similar global distributions of the ongoing star formation and more evolved stellar population. While no strong correlations are observed between stellar population parameters and morphology within the NIC2/SINFONI sample itself, a consideration of the sample in the context of a broader range of z ~ 2 galaxy types (K-selected quiescent, active galactic nucleus, and star forming; 24 mum selected dusty, infrared-luminous) indicates that these galaxies probe the high specific star formation rate and low stellar mass surface density part of the massive z ~ 2 galaxy population, with correspondingly large effective radii, low S{\'e}rsic indices, low G, and high Psi and M 20. The combined NIC2 and SINFONI data set yields insights of unprecedented detail into the nature of mass accretion at high redshift.

	Abstract = {We study the properties of luminous stellar "clumps" identified in deep, high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope NIC2/F160W imaging at 1.6 mum of six z ~ 2 star-forming galaxies with existing near-infrared integral field spectroscopy from SINFONI at the Very Large Telescope. Individual clumps contribute ~0.5%-15% of the galaxy-integrated rest-frame ≈5000 {\AA} emission, with median of ≈2% the total contribution of clump light ranges from 10% to 25%. The median intrinsic clump size and stellar mass are ~1 kpc and ~109 M sun, in the ranges for clumps identified in rest-UV or line emission in other studies. The clump sizes and masses in the subset of disks are broadly consistent with expectations for clump formation through gravitational instabilities in gas-rich, turbulent disks given the host galaxies' global properties. By combining the NIC2 data with Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS)/F814W imaging available for one source, and adaptive-optics-assisted SINFONI Halpha data for another, we infer modest color, M/L, and stellar age variations within each galaxy. In these two objects, sets of clumps identified at different wavelengths do not fully overlap; NIC2-identified clumps tend to be redder/older than ACS- or Halpha-identified clumps without rest-frame optical counterparts. There is evidence for a systematic trend of older ages at smaller galactocentric radii among the clumps, consistent with scenarios where inward migration of clumps transports material toward the central regions. From constraints on a bulge-like component at radii <~ 1-3 kpc, none of the five disks in our sample appears to contain a compact massive stellar core, and we do not discern a trend of bulge stellar mass fraction with stellar age of the galaxy. Further observations are necessary to probe the buildup of stellar bulges and the role of clumps in this process.

	Abstract = {Clump clusters and chain galaxies in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UDF) are examined for bulges in Near-Infrared Camera Multi-Object Spectrometer images. Approximately 50% of the clump clusters and 30% of the chains have relatively red and massive clumps that could be young bulges. Magnitudes and colors are determined for these bulgelike objects and for the bulges in spiral galaxies, and for all of the prominent star formation clumps in these three galaxy types. The colors are fitted to population evolution models to determine the bulge and clump masses, ages, star formation rate decay times, and extinctions. The results indicate that bulgelike objects in clump clusters and chain galaxies have similar ages and two to five times larger masses compared to the star formation clumps, while the bulges in spirals have roughly six times larger ages and 20 to 30 times larger masses than the clumps. All systems appear to have an underlying red disk population. The masses of star-forming clumps are typically in a range from 107 to 108 M sun; their ages have a wide range around ~102 Myr. Ages and extinctions both decrease with redshift. Star formation is probably the result of gravitational instabilities in the disk gas, in which case the large clump mass in the UDF is the result of a high gas velocity dispersion, 30 km s-1 or more, combined with a high gas mass column density, ~100 M sun pc-2. Because clump clusters and chains dominate disk galaxies beyond z ~ 1, the observations suggest that these types represent an early phase in the formation of modern spiral galaxies, when the bulge and inner disk formed.},

	Abstract = {The photometric redshift distributions, spectral types, S{\'e}rsic indices, and sizes of all resolved galaxies in the Hubble Space Telescope Ultra Deep Field (UDF) are studied in order to understand the environment and nature of star formation in the early universe. Clumpy disk galaxies that are bright at short wavelengths (rest-frame lambda<5000 {\AA}) dominate the UDF out to z~5.5. Their uniformity in V/Vmax and comoving volume density suggest that they go even further, spanning a total time more than an order of magnitude larger than their instantaneous star formation times. They precede as well as accompany the formation epoch of distant red galaxies and extreme red objects. Those preceding could be the premerger objects that combined to make red spheroidal types at z~2-3. Clumpy disks that do not undergo mergers are likely to evolve into spirals. The morphology of clumpy disks, the size and separation of the clumps, and the prevalence of this type of structure in the early universe suggests that most star formation occurs by self-gravitational collapse of disk gas.},

	Abstract = {Color-color diagrams for the clump and interclump emission in 10 clump-cluster galaxies of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UDF) are made from B,V, i, and z images and compared with models to determine redshifts, star formation histories, and galaxy masses. These galaxies are members of a class dominated by 5-10 giant clumps, with no exponential disk or bulge. The redshifts are found to be in the range from 1.6 to 3. The clump emission is typically 40% of the total galaxy emission, and the luminous clump mass is 19% of the total galaxy mass. The clump colors suggest declining star formation over the last ~0.3 Gyr, while the interclump emission is redder than the clumps, corresponding to a greater age. The clump luminous masses are typically 6×108 Msolar, and their diameters average 1.8 kpc, making their average density ~0.2 Msolar pc-3. Including the interclump populations, assumed to begin forming at z=6, the total galaxy luminous masses average 6.5×1010 Msolar and their diameters average 19 kpc to the 2 sigma noise level. The expected galaxy rotation speeds average ~150 km s-1 if they are uniformly rotating disks. The ages of the clumps are longer than their internal dynamical times by a factor of ~8, so they are stable star clusters, but the clump densities are only ~10 times the limiting tidal densities, so they could be deformed by tidal forces. This is consistent with the observation that some clumps have tails. The clumps could form by gravitational instabilities in accreting disk gas and then disperse on a ~1 Gyr timescale, building up the interclump disk emission, or they could be captured as gas-rich dwarf galaxies, flaring up with star formation at first and then dispersing. Support for this second possibility comes from the high abundance of nearly identical clumps in the UDF, smaller than 6 pixels, whose distributions on color-magnitude and color-color plots are the same as the galaxy clumps studied here. The distribution of axial ratios for the combined population of chain and clump-cluster galaxies in the UDF is compared with models and shown to be consistent with a thick-disk geometry. If these galaxies evolve into today's disk galaxies, then we are observing a stage in which accretion and star formation are extremely clumpy and the resulting high velocity dispersions form thick disks. Several clump-clusters have disk densities that are much larger than in local disks, however, suggesting an alternate model in which they do not survive until today, but get converted into ellipticals by collisions.},

@article{Brooks:2009jk,
	Abstract = {We use high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to demonstrate that cold flow gas accretion, particularly along filaments, modifies the standard picture of gas accretion and cooling onto galaxy disks. In the standard picture, all gas is initially heated to the virial temperature of the galaxy as it enters the virial radius. Low-mass galaxies are instead dominated by accretion of gas that stays well below the virial temperature, and even when a hot halo is able to develop in more massive galaxies there exist dense filaments that penetrate inside of the virial radius and deliver cold gas to the central galaxy. For galaxies up to ~L*, this cold accretion gas is responsible for the star formation (SF) in the disk at all times to the present. Even for galaxies at higher masses, cold flows dominate the growth of the disk at early times. Within this modified picture, galaxies are able to accrete a large mass of cold gas, with lower initial gas temperatures leading to shorter cooling times to reach the disk. Although SF in the disk is mitigated by supernovae feedback, the short cooling times allow for the growth of stellar disks at higher redshifts than predicted by the standard model.},

	Abstract = {We address the origin of the robust bimodality observed in galaxy properties about a characteristic stellar mass ~3 × 1010Msolar. Less massive galaxies tend to be ungrouped blue star forming discs, while more massive galaxies are typically grouped red old-star spheroids. Colour-magnitude data show a gap between the red and blue sequences, extremely red luminous galaxies already at z~ 1, a truncation of today's blue sequence above L*, and massive starbursts at z~ 2-4. We propose that these features are driven by the thermal properties of the inflowing gas and their interplay with the clustering and feedback processes, all functions of the dark matter halo mass and associated with a similar characteristic scale. In haloes below a critical shock-heating mass Mshock<~ 1012Msolar, discs are built by cold streams, not heated by a virial shock, yielding efficient early star formation. It is regulated by supernova feedback into a long sequence of bursts in blue galaxies constrained to a `fundamental line'. Cold streams penetrating through hot media in M>=Mshock haloes preferentially at z>= 2 lead to massive starbursts in L > L* galaxies. At z < 2, in M > Mshock haloes hosting groups, the gas is heated by a virial shock, and being dilute it becomes vulnerable to feedback from energetic sources such as active galactic nuclei. This shuts off gas supply and prevents further star formation, leading by passive evolution to `red-and-dead' massive spheroids starting at z~ 1. A minimum in feedback efficiency near Mshock explains the observed minimum in M/L and the qualitative features of the star formation history. The cold flows provide a hint for solving the angular momentum problem. When these processes are incorporated in simulations they recover the main bimodality features and solve other open puzzles.},

@article{Brammer:2008uq,
	Abstract = {We describe a new program for determining photometric redshifts, dubbed EAZY. The program is optimized for cases where spectroscopic redshifts are not available, or are only available for a biased subset of the galaxies. The code combines features from various existing codes: it can fit linear combinations of templates, it includes optional flux- and redshift-based priors, and its user interface is modeled on the popular HYPERZ code. A novel feature is that the default template set, as well as the default functional forms of the priors, are not based on (usually highly biased) spectroscopic samples, but on semianalytical models. Furthermore, template mismatch is addressed by a novel rest-frame template error function. This function gives different wavelength regions different weights, and ensures that the formal redshift uncertainties are realistic. We introduce a redshift quality parameter, Qz, which provides a robust estimate of the reliability of the photometric redshift estimate. Despite the fact that EAZY is not ''trained'' on spectroscopic samples, the code (with default parameters) performs very well on existing public data sets. For K-selected samples in CDF-South and other deep fields, we find a 1 sigma scatter in Deltaz/(1+z) of 0.034, and we provide updated photometric redshift catalogs for the FIRES, MUSYC, and FIREWORKS surveys.},

@article{Peng:2010qy,
	Abstract = {We present a two-dimensional (2D) fitting algorithm (GALFIT, ver. 3) with new capabilities to study the structural components of galaxies and other astronomical objects in digital images. Our technique improves on previous 2D fitting algorithms by allowing for irregular, curved, logarithmic and power-law spirals, ring, and truncated shapes in otherwise traditional parametric functions like the S{\'e}rsic, Moffat, King, Ferrer, etc., profiles. One can mix and match these new shape features freely, with or without constraints, and apply them to an arbitrary number of model components of numerous profile types, so as to produce realistic-looking galaxy model images. Yet, despite the potential for extreme complexity, the meaning of the key parameters like the S{\'e}rsic index, effective radius, or luminosity remains intuitive and essentially unchanged. The new features have an interesting potential for use to quantify the degree of asymmetry of galaxies, to quantify low surface brightness tidal features beneath and beyond luminous galaxies, to allow more realistic decompositions of galaxy subcomponents in the presence of strong rings and spiral arms, and to enable ways to gauge the uncertainties when decomposing galaxy subcomponents. We illustrate these new features by way of several case studies that display various levels of complexity.},

@article{Livermore:2012fk,
	Abstract = {We present Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3 narrow-band imaging of the Halpha emission in a sample of eight gravitationally lensed galaxies at z = 1-1.5. The magnification caused by the foreground clusters enables us to obtain a median source plane spatial resolution of 360 pc, as well as providing magnifications in flux ranging from ˜10× to ˜50×. This enables us to identify resolved star-forming H II regions at this epoch and therefore study their Halpha luminosity distributions for comparisons with equivalent samples at z ˜ 2 and in the local Universe. We find evolution in the both luminosity and surface brightness of H II regions with redshift. The distribution of clump properties can be quantified with an H II region luminosity function, which can be fit by a power law with an exponential break at some cut-off, and we find that the cut-off evolves with redshift. We therefore conclude that 'clumpy' galaxies are seen at high redshift because of the evolution of the cut-off mass; the galaxies themselves follow similar scaling relations to those at z = 0, but their H II regions are larger and brighter and thus appear as clumps which dominate the morphology of the galaxy. A simple theoretical argument based on gas collapsing on scales of the Jeans mass in a marginally unstable disc shows that the clumpy morphologies of high-z galaxies are driven by the competing effects of higher gas fractions causing perturbations on larger scales, partially compensated by higher epicyclic frequencies which stabilize the disc.},

	Abstract = {CO line emission represents the most accessible and widely used tracer of the molecular ISM. This renders the translation of observed CO intensity into total H2 gas mass critical to understanding star formation and the ISM in our Galaxy and beyond. We review the theoretical underpinning, techniques, and results of efforts to estimate this CO-to-H2 ``conversion factor,'' XCO, in different environments. In the Milky Way disk, we recommend a conversion factor of [Formula: see text] cm-2 (K km s-1)-1 with $\pm$30% uncertainty. Studies of other ``normal galaxies'' return similar values in Milky Way-like disks, but with greater scatter and systematic uncertainty. Departures from this Galactic conversion factor are both observed and expected. Dust-based determinations, theoretical arguments, and scaling relations all suggest that XCO increases with decreasing metallicity, turning up sharply below metallicity ˜1/3-1/2 solar in a manner consistent with model predictions that identify shielding as a key parameter. Based on spectral line modeling and dust observations, XCO appears to drop in the central, bright regions of some but not all galaxies, often coincident with regions of bright CO emission and high stellar surface density. This lower XCO is also present in the overwhelmingly molecular ISM of starburst galaxies, where several lines of evidence point to a lower CO-to-H2 conversion factor. At high redshift, direct evidence regarding the conversion factor remains scarce; we review what is known based on dynamical modeling and other arguments.},

	Abstract = {We test the effects of varying the cosmological parameter values used in the strong lens modeling process for the six Hubble Frontier Field (HFF) galaxy clusters. The standard procedure for generating high-fidelity strong lens models includes careful consideration of uncertainties in the output models that result from varying model parameters within the bounds of available data constraints. It is not, however, common practice to account for the effects of cosmological parameter value uncertainties. The convention is to instead use a single fiducial ``concordance cosmology'' and generate lens models assuming zero uncertainty in cosmological parameter values. We find that the magnification maps of the individual HFF clusters vary significantly when lens models are computed using different cosmological parameter values taken from recent literature constraints from space- and ground-based experiments. Specifically, the magnification maps have average variances across the best-fit models computed using different cosmologies that are comparable in magnitude to---and as much as 2.5× larger than---the model-fitting uncertainties in each best-fit model. We also find that estimates of the mass profiles of the cluster cores themselves vary only slightly when different input cosmological parameters are used. We conclude that cosmological parameter uncertainty is a non-negligible source of uncertainty in lens model products for the HFF clusters and that it is important that current and future work that relies on precision strong-lensing models take care to account for this additional source of uncertainty.},

@article{Hennawi:2007ek,
	Abstract = {We present a detailed investigation into which properties of CDM halos make them effective strong gravitational lenses. Strong-lensing cross sections of 878 clusters from an N-body simulation are measured by ray-tracing through 13,594 unique projections. We measure concentrations, axis ratios, orientations, and the substructure of each cluster, and compare the lensing-weighted distribution of each quantity to that of the cluster population as a whole. The concentrations of lensing clusters are on average 34% larger than the typical cluster in the universe. Despite this bias, the anomalously high concentrations (c>14) recently measured by several groups appear to be inconsistent with the concentration distribution in our simulations, which predict that <2% of lensing clusters should have concentrations this high. No correlation is found between lensing cross section and substructure. We introduce several types of simplified dark matter halos and use them to isolate which properties of CDM clusters make them effective lenses. The abundance of giant arcs is primarily determined by the mass distribution within an average overdensity of ~10,000. A multiple-lens-plane ray-tracing algorithm is used to show that projections of large-scale structure increase the giant arc abundance modestly, by <7%. We revisit the claimed excess of giant arcs behind high redshift clusters in the RCS survey and find that the number of high-redshift (z>0.6) lenses is in good agreement with LambdaCDM, although our simulations predict more low-redshift (z<0.6) lenses than observed.},

@article{Evrard:2008uo,
	Abstract = {We present a precise estimate of the bulk virial scaling relation of halos formed via hierarchical clustering in an ensemble of simulated cold dark matter cosmologies. The result is insensitive to cosmological parameters; the presence of a trace, dissipationless gas component; and numerical resolution down to a limit of ~1000 particles. The dark matter velocity dispersion scales with total mass as log[sigmaDM(M,z)=log(1082.9+/-4.0 km s-1)+(0.3361+/-0.0026)log[h(z)M200/1015 Msolar, with h(z) being the dimensionless Hubble parameter. At fixed mass, the velocity dispersion likelihood is nearly lognormal, with scatter sigmalnsigma=0.0426+/-0.015, except for a tail with higher dispersions containing 10% of the population that are merger transients. We combine this relation with the halo mass function in LambdaCDM models and show that a low normalization condition, S8=sigma8(Omegam/0.3)0.35=0.69, favored by recent WMAP and SDSS analysis requires that galaxy and gas-specific energies in rich clusters be 50% larger than that of the underlying dark matter. Such large energetic biases are in conflict with the current generation of direct simulations of cluster formation. A higher normalization, S8=0.80, alleviates this tension and implies that the hot gas fraction within r500 is (0.71+/-0.09) h-3/270 Omegab/Omegam, a value consistent with recent Sunyaev-Zel'dovich observations.},

@article{Hook:2004yq,
	Abstract = {Results of the commissioning of the first Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) are described. GMOS and the Gemini-North telescope act as a complete system to exploit a large 8 m aperture with improved image quality. Key GMOS design features such as the on-instrument wave-front sensor (OIWFS) and active flexure compensation system maintain very high image quality and stability, allowing precision observations of many targets simultaneously while reducing the need for frequent recalibration and reacquisition of targets. In this paper, example observations in imaging, long-slit, and multiobject spectroscopic modes are presented and verified by comparison with data from the literature. The expected high throughput of GMOS is confirmed from standard star observations; it peaks at about 60% when imaging in the r' and i' bands, and at 45%-50% in spectroscopic mode at 6300 {\AA}. Deep GMOS photometry in the g', r', and i' filters is compared to data from the literature, and the uniformity of this photometry across the GMOS field is verified. The multiobject spectroscopic mode is demonstrated by observations of the galaxy cluster A383. Centering of objects in the multislit mask was achieved to an rms accuracy of 80 mas across the 5.5m field, and an optimized setup procedure (now in regular use) improves this to better than 50 mas. Stability during these observations was high, as expected: the average shift between object and slit positions was 5.3 mas hr-1, and the wavelength scale drifted by only 0.1 {\AA} hr-1 (in a setup with spectral resolution of 6 {\AA}). Finally, the current status of GMOS on Gemini-North is summarized, and future plans are outlined.},

@article{Benitez:2009rf,
	Abstract = {In the coming years, several cosmological surveys will rely on imaging data to estimate the redshift of galaxies, using traditional filter systems with 4-5 optical broad bands; narrower filters improve the spectral resolution, but strongly reduce the total system throughput. We explore how photometric redshift performance depends on the number of filters nf , characterizing the survey depth by the fraction of galaxies with unambiguous redshift estimates. For a combination of total exposure time and telescope imaging area of 270 hr m2, 4-5 filter systems perform significantly worse, both in completeness depth and precision, than systems with nf gsim 8 filters. Our results suggest that for low nf the color-redshift degeneracies overwhelm the improvements in photometric depth, and that even at higher nf the effective photometric redshift depth decreases much more slowly with filter width than naively expected from the reduction in the signal-to-noise ratio. Adding near-IR observations improves the performance of low-nf systems, but still the system which maximizes the photometric redshift completeness is formed by nine filters with logarithmically increasing bandwidth (constant resolution) and half-band overlap, reaching ~0.7 mag deeper, with 10% better redshift precision, than 4-5 filter systems. A system with 20 constant-width, nonoverlapping filters reaches only ~0.1 mag shallower than 4-5 filter systems, but has a precision almost three times better, deltaz = 0.014(1 + z) versus deltaz = 0.042(1 + z). We briefly discuss a practical implementation of such a photometric system: the ALHAMBRA Survey.},

	Abstract = {We measure the UV-continuum slope beta for over 4000 high-redshift galaxies over a wide range of redshifts z ~ 4-8 and luminosities from the HST HUDF/XDF, HUDF09-1, HUDF09-2, ERS, CANDELS-N, and CANDELS-S data sets. Our new beta results reach very faint levels at z ~ 4 (-15.5 mag: 0.006  Lz=3*), z ~ 5 (-16.5 mag: 0.014 Lz=3*), and z ~ 6 and z ~ 7 (-17 mag: 0.025 Lz=3*). Inconsistencies between previous studies led us to conduct a comprehensive review of systematic errors and develop a new technique for measuring beta that is robust against biases that arise from the impact of noise. We demonstrate, by object-by-object comparisons, that all previous studies, including our own and those done on the latest HUDF12 data set, suffered from small systematic errors in beta. We find that after correcting for the systematic errors (typically Deltabeta ~ 0.1-0.2) all beta results at z ~ 7 from different groups are in excellent agreement. The mean beta we measure for faint (-18 mag: 0.1 Lz=3*) z ~ 4, z ~ 5, z ~ 6, and z ~ 7 galaxies is -2.03 $\pm$ 0.03 $\pm$ 0.06 (random and systematic errors), -2.14 $\pm$ 0.06 $\pm$ 0.06, -2.24 $\pm$ 0.11 $\pm$ 0.08, and -2.30 $\pm$ 0.18 $\pm$ 0.13, respectively. Our new beta values are redder than we have reported in the past, but bluer than other recent results. Our previously reported trend of bluer beta's at lower luminosities is confirmed, as is the evolution to bluer beta's at high redshifts. beta appears to show only a mild luminosity dependence faintward of M UV, AB ~ -19 mag, suggesting that the mean beta asymptotes to ~-2.2 to -2.4 for faint z >= 4 galaxies. At z ~ 7, the observed beta's suggest non-zero, but low dust extinction, and they agree well with values predicted in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations.},

@article{Bouwens:2015lr,
	Abstract = {The remarkable Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data sets from the CANDELS, HUDF09, HUDF12, ERS, and BoRG/HIPPIES programs have allowed us to map the evolution of the rest-frame UV luminosity function (LF) from z~ 10 to z~ 4. We develop new color criteria that more optimally utilize the full wavelength coverage from the optical, near-IR, and mid-IR observations over our search fields, while simultaneously minimizing the incompleteness and eliminating redshift gaps. We have identified 5859, 3001, 857, 481, 217, and 6 galaxy candidates at z~ 4, z~ 5, z~ 6, z~ 7, z~ 8, and z~ 10, respectively, from the ~1000 arcmin2 area covered by these data sets. This sample of >10,000 galaxy candidates at z>=slant 4 is by far the largest assembled to date with HST. The selection of z ~  4--8 candidates over the five CANDELS fields allows us to assess the cosmic variance; the largest variations are at z>=slant 7. Our new LF determinations at z~ 4 and z~ 5 span a 6 mag baseline and reach to --16 AB mag. These determinations agree well with previous estimates, but the larger samples and volumes probed here result in a more reliable sampling of \gt {{L}*} galaxies and allow us to reassess the form of the UV LFs. Our new LF results strengthen our earlier findings to 3.4sigma  significance for a steeper faint-end slope of the UV LF at z\gt 4, with alpha evolving from alpha =-1.64+/- 0.04 at z~ 4 to alpha =-2.06+/- 0.13 at z~ 7 (and alpha =-2.02+/- 0.23 at z~ 8), consistent with that expected from the evolution of the halo mass function. We find less evolution in the characteristic magnitude M* from z~ 7 to z~ 4; the observed evolution in the LF is now largely represented by changes in {{phi }*}. No evidence for a non-Schechter-like form to the z ~ 4--8 LFs is found. A simple conditional LF model based on halo growth and evolution in the M/L ratio (\propto {{(1+z)}-1.5}) of halos provides a good representation of the observed evolution.  Based on observations obtained with MegaPrime/MegaCam, a joint project of CFHT and CEA/IRFU, at the Canada--France--Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), which is operated by the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada, the Institut National des Science de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) of France, and the University of Hawaii. This work is based in part on data products produced at Terapix available at the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre as part of the Canada--France--Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey, a collaborative project of NRC and CNRS.},

@article{Smith:2005kx,
	Abstract = {We present a comprehensive space-based study of 10 X-ray luminous galaxy clusters (LX>= 8 × 1044 erg s-1, 0.1-2.4 keV) at z= 0.2. Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations reveal numerous gravitationally lensed arcs for which we present four new spectroscopic redshifts, bringing the total to 13 confirmed arcs in this cluster sample. The confirmed arcs reside in just half of the clusters; we thus obtain a firm lower limit on the fraction of clusters with a central projected mass density exceeding the critical density required for strong lensing of 50 per cent. We combine the multiple-image systems with the weakly sheared background galaxies to model the total mass distribution in the cluster cores (R<= 500 kpc). These models are complemented by high-resolution X-ray data from Chandra and used to develop quantitative criteria to classify the clusters as relaxed or unrelaxed. Formally, (30 +/- 20) per cent of the clusters form a relatively homogeneous subsample of relaxed clusters; the remaining (70 +/- 20) per cent are unrelaxed and are a much more diverse population. Most of the clusters therefore appear to be experiencing a cluster-cluster merger or relaxing after such an event. We also study the normalization and scatter of scaling relations between the cluster mass, the X-ray luminosity and the temperature. The scatter in these relations is dominated by the unrelaxed clusters and is typically sigma~= 0.4. Most notably, we detect two to three times more scatter in the mass-temperature relation than theoretical simulations and models predict. The observed scatter is also asymmetric - the unrelaxed clusters are systematically 40 per cent hotter than the relaxed clusters at 2.5sigma significance. This structural segregation should be a major concern for experiments designed to constrain cosmological parameters using galaxy clusters. Overall our results are consistent with a scenario of cluster-cluster merger-induced boosts to cluster X-ray luminosities and temperatures.},

	Abstract = {We present the mass distribution at the core of SDSS J1531+3414, a strong-lensing cluster at z = 0.335. We find that the mass distribution is well described by two cluster-scale halos with a contribution from cluster-member galaxies. New Hubble Space Telescope observations of SDSS J1531+3414 reveal a signature of ongoing star formation associated with the two central galaxies at the core of the cluster, in the form of a chain of star forming regions at the center of the cluster. Using the lens model presented here, we place upper limits on the contribution of a possible lensed image to the flux at the central region, and rule out that this emission is coming from a background source.

We include more lensing constraints from the host galaxy of the newly discovered supernova, and increase the flexibility of the model in order to better reproduce the lensing signal in the vicinity of this galaxy. The revised model accurately reconstructs the positions of the lensed supernova, provides magnifications, and predicts the time delay between the instances of the supernova. Finally, we reconstruct the source image of the host galaxy, and position the supernova on one of its spiral arms. Products of this lens model are available to the community through MAST.},

	Abstract = {We present new observations of the lensing cluster SMACSJ2031.8-4036 obtained with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) integral field spectrograph as part of its commissioning on the Very Large Telescope. By providing medium-resolution spectroscopy over the full 4750-9350 {\AA} domain and a 1 × 1 arcmin2 field of view, MUSE is ideally suited for identifying lensed galaxies in the cluster core, in particular multiple-imaged systems. We perform a redshift analysis of all sources in the data cube and identify a total of 12 systems ranging from z = 1.46 to 6.4, with all images of each system confirmed by a spectroscopic redshift. This allows us to accurately constrain the cluster mass profile in this region. We foresee that future MUSE observations of cluster cores should help us discover very faint Lyman alpha emitters thanks to the strong magnification and the high sensitivity of this instrument.},

	Abstract = {We present strong-lensing models as well as mass and magnification maps for the cores of the six Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Frontier Fields galaxy clusters. Our parametric lens models are constrained by the locations and redshifts of multiple image systems of lensed background galaxies. We use a combination of photometric redshifts and spectroscopic redshifts of the lensed background sources obtained by us (for A2744 and AS1063), collected from the literature, or kindly provided by the lensing community. Using our results, we (1) compare the derived mass distribution of each cluster to its light distribution, (2) quantify the cumulative magnification power of the HST Frontier Fields clusters, (3) describe how our models can be used to estimate the magnification and image multiplicity of lensed background sources at all redshifts and at any position within the cluster cores, and (4) discuss systematic effects and caveats resulting from our modeling methods. We specifically investigate the effect of the use of spectroscopic and photometric redshift constraints on the uncertainties of the resulting models. We find that the photometric redshift estimates of lensed galaxies are generally in excellent agreement with spectroscopic redshifts, where available. However, the flexibility associated with relaxed redshift priors may cause the complexity of large-scale structure that is needed to account for the lensing signal to be underestimated. Our findings thus underline the importance of spectroscopic arc redshifts, or tight photometric redshift constraints, for high precision lens models. All products from our best-fit lens models (magnification, convergence, shear, deflection field) and model simulations for estimating errors are made available via the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes.  Based on observations made with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile and the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained through the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.

@article{Bartelmann:1998fr,
	Abstract = {We use numerical simulations of galaxy clusters in different cosmologies to study their ability to form large arcs. The cosmological models are: Standard CDM (SCDM; Omega_0 =1, Omega_ Lambda =0); tau CDM with reduced small-scale power (parameters as SCDM, but with a smaller shape parameter of the power spectrum); open CDM (OCDM; Omega_0 =0.3, Omega_ Lambda =0); and spatially flat, low-density CDM (Lambda CDM; Omega_0 =0.3, Omega_ Lambda =0.7). All models are normalised to the local number density of rich clusters. Simulating gravitational lensing by these clusters, we compute optical depths for the formation of large arcs. For large arcs with length-to-width ratio >=10, the optical depth is largest for OCDM. Relative to OCDM, the optical depth is lower by about an order of magnitude for Lambda CDM, and by about two orders of magnitude for S/tau CDM. These differences originate from the different epochs of cluster formation across the cosmological models, and from the non-linearity of the strong lensing effect. We conclude that only the OCDM model can reproduce the observed arc abundance well, while the other models fail to do so by orders of magnitude.},

	Abstract = {We present an analysis of the MUSIC-2 N-body/hydrodynamical simulations aimed at estimating the expected concentration-mass relation for the CLASH (Cluster Lensing and Supernova Survey with Hubble) cluster sample. We study nearly 1,400 halos simulated at high spatial and mass resolution. We study the shape of both their density and surface-density profiles and fit them with a variety of radial functions, including the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW), the generalized NFW, and the Einasto density profiles. We derive concentrations and masses from these fits. We produce simulated Chandra observations of the halos, and we use them to identify objects resembling the X-ray morphologies and masses of the clusters in the CLASH X-ray-selected sample. We also derive a concentration-mass relation for strong-lensing clusters. We find that the sample of simulated halos that resembles the X-ray morphology of the CLASH clusters is composed mainly of relaxed halos, but it also contains a significant fraction of unrelaxed systems. For such a heterogeneous sample we measure an average two-dimensional concentration that is ~11% higher than is found for the full sample of simulated halos. After accounting for projection and selection effects, the average NFW concentrations of CLASH clusters are expected to be intermediate between those predicted in three dimensions for relaxed and super-relaxed halos. Matching the simulations to the individual CLASH clusters on the basis of the X-ray morphology, we expect that the NFW concentrations recovered from the lensing analysis of the CLASH clusters are in the range [3-6], with an average value of 3.87 and a standard deviation of 0.61.},

	Abstract = {The observed incidence of strongly lensing clusters exceeds the predictions of a LambdaCDM model by about a factor of 10. We revisit the observational side of this discrepancy by measuring the incidence of strong lensing in a subsample of clusters drawn from the Las Campanas Distant Cluster Survey (LCDCS). Among clusters with 0.5<=z<=0.7, the redshift range in which we focus our search, we find two strongly lensed systems within an effective search area of 69 deg2. There is at least one other strongly lensed system in the LCDCS outside of this redshift range, where we are less complete. Over all redshifts, the LambdaCDM model produces one large arc every 146 deg2. Assuming Poisson statistics, the probability of finding three or more strongly lensing clusters in 69 deg2 is 0.012. The lensing incidence within the LCDCS is in agreement with that derived from an X-ray-selected sample and what has been preliminarily presented from an independent optical cluster survey. The origin of the disagreement between theory and observations, which remains at least at the order-of-magnitude scale for the LambdaCDM model, lies either in the concordance cosmological model, in the characteristics of the resulting cluster potentials, or in the adopted source population.},

From the spectral analysis of the arc it is now well established that all its segments (including the eastern end) have the same spectrum. Some emission and absorption features identified in the spectrum definitely prove that the arc is the image of a late type galaxy at a redshift of 0.724. Gravitational lensing of a background galaxy by the cluster core results as the most convincing model of the observed configuration.},

	Abstract = {Extending over three Hubble Space Telescope (HST) cycles, the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) initiative constitutes the largest commitment ever of HST time to the exploration of the distant Universe via gravitational lensing by massive galaxy clusters. Here, we present models of the mass distribution in the six HFF cluster lenses, derived from a joint strong- and weak-lensing analysis anchored by a total of 88 multiple-image systems identified in existing HST data. The resulting maps of the projected mass distribution and of the gravitational magnification effectively calibrate the HFF clusters as gravitational telescopes. Allowing the computation of search areas in the source plane, these maps are provided to the community to facilitate the exploitation of forthcoming HFF data for quantitative studies of the gravitationally lensed population of background galaxies. Our models of the gravitational magnification afforded by the HFF clusters allow us to quantify the lensing-induced boost in sensitivity over blank-field observations and predict that galaxies at z > 10 and as faint as m(AB) = 32 will be detectable, up to 2 mag fainter than the limit of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field.},

@article{Jouvel:2014qy,
	Abstract = {Context. The Cluster Lensing And Supernovae survey with Hubble (CLASH) is a Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Multi-Cycle Treasury programme thatobserves 25 massive galaxy clusters, 20 of which were X-ray-selected to preferably choose dynamically relaxed clusters, and 5 additional "high magnification" clusters, which were selected based on their optical lensing properties. CLASH aims to study the dark matter distribution of the clusters and find magnified high-redshift galaxies behind them. CLASH observations were carried out in 16 bands from UV to NIR to derive accurate and reliable estimates of photometric redshifts.  Aims: We present the CLASH photometric redshifts using 16 HST bands and study the photometric redshift accuracy including a detailed comparison between photometric and spectroscopic redshifts for the strong lensing arcs using the measurements from the cluster MACSJ1206.2-0847.  Methods: We used the publicly available Le Phare and BPZ photometric redshift estimation codes on 17 CLASH galaxy clusters for which the full photo-z data processing had been completed at the time of this analysis, and derive an estimate of the CLASH photo-z accuracy.  Results: Using Le Phare code for objects with a S/N >= 10, we reach a precision of 3%(1 + z) for the strong lensing arcs, which is reduced to 2.4%(1 + z) after removing outliers. For galaxies in the cluster field, the corresponding values are 4%(1 + z) and 3%(1 + z). Using mock galaxy catalogues, we show that 3%(1 + z) precision is what is expected using the baseline sky substraction algorithm when taking into account extinction from dust, emission lines, and the finite range of SEDs included in the photo-z template library. An improved method for estimating galaxy colours that yields more accurate photometric redshifts will be explored in a forthcoming paper. We study photo-z results for different aperture photometry techniques and find that the SExtractor isophotal photometry works best. We check the robustness of the arcs photo-z results by rederiving the input photometry in the case of MACS1206. We describe and release a photometric redshift catalogue of the MACS1206 cluster we study.  Conclusions: Our photo-z codes give similar results for the strong lensing arcs, as well as for galaxies of the cluster field. Results are improved when optimizing the photometric aperture shape that shows an optimal aperture size around 1'' radius, giving results that are equivalent to isophotal photometry. Tailored photometry of the arcs improves the photo-z results by showing more consistency between the different arcs of the same strong lensing system.

	Abstract = {We present a quintuply lensed z ˜ 6 candidate discovered in the field of the galaxy cluster RXC J2248.7-4431 (z ˜ 0.348) targeted within the Cluster Lensing and Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH) and selected in the deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) frontier fields survey. Thanks to the CLASH 16-band HST imaging, we identify the quintuply lensed z ˜ 6 candidate as an optical dropout in the inner region of the cluster, the brightest image having magAB = 24.8 $\pm$ 0.1 in the f105w filter. We perform a detailed photometric analysis to verify its high-z and lensed nature. We get as photometric redshift zph ˜ 5.9, and given the extended nature and NIR colours of the lensed images, we rule out low-z early-type and galactic star contaminants. We perform a strong lensing analysis of the cluster, using 13 families of multiple lensed images identified in the HST images. Our final best model predicts the high-z quintuply lensed system with a position accuracy of 0.8 arcsec. The magnifications of the five images are between 2.2 and 8.3, which leads to a delensed UV luminosity of L_{1600}˜ 0.5L_{1600}^* at z = 6. We also estimate the UV slope from the observed NIR colours, finding a steep beta = -2.89 $\pm$ 0.38. We use singular and composite stellar population SEDs to fit the photometry of the high-z candidate, and we conclude that it is a young (age <300 Myr) galaxy with mass of M ˜ 108 M&sun;, subsolar metallicity (Z < 0.2 Z&sun;) and low dust content (AV ˜ 0.2-0.4).},

	Abstract = {We have measured the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect for a sample of 10 strong lensing selected galaxy clusters using the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Array (SZA). The SZA is sensitive to structures on spatial scales of a few arcminutes, while the strong lensing mass modeling constrains the mass at small scales (typically <30''). Combining the two provides information about the projected concentrations of the strong lensing clusters. The Einstein radii we measure are twice as large as expected given the masses inferred from SZ scaling relations. A Monte Carlo simulation indicates that a sample randomly drawn from the expected distribution would have a larger median Einstein radius than the observed clusters about 3% of the time. The implied overconcentration has been noted in previous studies and persists for this sample, even when we take into account that we are selecting large Einstein radius systems, suggesting that the theoretical models still do not fully describe the observed properties of strong lensing clusters.},

	Abstract = {The existence of an arc statistics problem was at the center of a strong debate in the last fifteen years. With the aim to clarify if the optical depth for giant gravitational arcs by galaxy clusters in the so called concordance model is compatible with observations, several studies were carried out which helped to significantly improve our knowledge of strong lensing clusters, unveiling their extremely complex internal structure. In particular, the abundance and the frequency of strong lensing events like gravitational arcs turned out to be a potentially very powerful tool to trace the structure formation. However, given the limited size of observational and theoretical data-sets, the power of arc statistics as a cosmological tool has been only minimally exploited so far. On the other hand, the last years were characterized by significant advancements in the field, and several cluster surveys that are ongoing or planned for the near future seem to have the potential to make arc statistics a competitive cosmological probe. Additionally, recent observations of anomalously large Einstein radii and concentrations in galaxy clusters have reinvigorated the debate on the arc statistics problem. In this paper, we review the work done so far on arc statistics, focussing on what is the lesson we learned and what is likely to improve in the next years.},

	Abstract = {The galaxy cluster IDCS J1426.5+3508 at z = 1.75 is the most massive galaxy cluster yet discovered at z > 1.4 and the first cluster at this epoch for which the Sunyaev-Zel'Dovich effect has been observed. In this paper, we report on the discovery with Hubble Space Telescope imaging of a giant arc associated with this cluster. The curvature of the arc suggests that the lensing mass is nearly coincident with the brightest cluster galaxy, and the color is consistent with the arc being a star-forming galaxy. We compare the constraint on M 200 based upon strong lensing with Sunyaev-Zel'Dovich results, finding that the two are consistent if the redshift of the arc is z >~ 3. Finally, we explore the cosmological implications of this system, considering the likelihood of the existence of a strongly lensing galaxy cluster at this epoch in a LambdaCDM universe. While the existence of the cluster itself can potentially be accommodated if one considers the entire volume covered at this redshift by all current high-redshift cluster surveys, the existence of this strongly lensed galaxy greatly exacerbates the long-standing giant arc problem. For standard LambdaCDM structure formation and observed background field galaxy counts this lens system should not exist. Specifically, there should be no giant arcs in the entire sky as bright in F814W as the observed arc for clusters at z >= 1.75, and only ~0.3 as bright in F160W as the observed arc. If we relax the redshift constraint to consider all clusters at z >= 1.5, the expected number of giant arcs rises to ~15 in F160W, but the number of giant arcs of this brightness in F814W remains zero. These arc statistic results are independent of the mass of IDCS J1426.5+3508. We consider possible explanations for this discrepancy.},

@article{Horesh:2011lr,
	Abstract = {It has been debated for a decade whether there is a large overabundance of strongly lensed arcs in galaxyclusters, compared to expectations from Lambda cold dark matter cosmology. We perform ray tracing through the most massive haloes of the Millennium simulation at several redshifts in their evolution, using the Hubble Ultra Deep Field as a source image, to produce realistic simulated lensed images. We compare the lensed arc statistics measured from the simulations to those of a sample of 45 X-ray selected clusters, observed with the Hubble Space Telescope, that we have analysed in Horesh et al. The observations and the simulations are matched in cluster masses, redshifts, observational effects, and the algorithmic arc detection and selection. At z= 0.6, there are too few massive-enough clusters in the Millennium volume for a proper statistical comparison with the observations. At redshifts 0.3 < z < 0.5, however, we have large numbers of simulated and observed clusters, and the latter are an unbiased selection from a complete sample. For these redshifts, we find excellent agreement between the observed and simulated arc statistics, in terms of the mean number of arcs per cluster, the distribution of number of arcs per cluster and the angular separation distribution. At z≈ 0.2 some conflict remains, with real clusters being ˜3 times more efficient arc producers than their simulated counterparts. This may arise due to selection biases in the observed subsample at this redshift, to some mismatch in masses between the observed and simulated clusters or to physical effects that arise at low redshift and enhance the lensing efficiency, but which are not represented by the simulations.},

@article{Faber:2007fj,
	Abstract = {The DEEP2 and COMBO-17 surveys are compared to study luminosity functions of red and blue galaxies to z~1. The two surveys have different methods and sensitivities, but nevertheless results agree. After z~1, M*B has dimmed by 1.2-1.3 mag for all colors of galaxies, phi* for blue galaxies has hardly changed, and phi* for red galaxies has at least doubled (our formal value is ~0.5 dex). Luminosity density jB has fallen by 0.6 dex for blue galaxies but has remained nearly constant for red galaxies. These results imply that the number and total stellar mass of blue galaxies have been substantially constant since z~1, whereas those of red galaxies (near L*) have been significantly rising. To explain the new red galaxies, a ``mixed'' scenario is proposed in which star formation in blue cloud galaxies is quenched, causing them to migrate to the red sequence, where they merge further in a small number of stellar mergers. This mixed scenario matches the local boxy-disky transition for nearby ellipticals, as well as red sequence stellar population scaling laws such as the color-magnitude and Mg-sigma relations (which are explained as fossil relics from blue progenitors). Blue galaxies enter the red sequence via different quenching modes, each of which peaks at a different characteristic mass and time. The red sequence therefore likely builds up in different ways at different times and masses, and the concept of a single process that is ``downsizing'' (or upsizing) probably does not apply. Our claim in this paper of a rise in the number of red galaxies applies to galaxies near L*. Accurate counts of brighter galaxies on the steep part of the Schechter function require more accurate photometry than is currently available.  Based on observations taken at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated jointly by the University of California and the California Institute of Technology, and on observations made with the NASA/ESO Hubble Space Telescope, obtained from the data archives at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555, and from the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre.},

	Abstract = {In strong gravitational lens systems, the light bending is usually dominated by one main galaxy, but may be affected by other mass along the line of sight (LOS). Shear and convergence can be used to approximate the contributions from less significant perturbers (e.g. those that are projected far from the lens or have a small mass), but higher order effects need to be included for objects that are closer or more massive. We develop a framework for multiplane lensing that can handle an arbitrary combination of tidal planes treated with shear and convergence and planes treated exactly (i.e. including higher order terms). This framework addresses all of the traditional lensing observables including image positions, fluxes, and time delays to facilitate lens modelling that includes the non-linear effects due to mass along the LOS. It balances accuracy (accounting for higher order terms when necessary) with efficiency (compressing all other LOS effects into a set of matrices that can be calculated up front and cached for lens modelling). We identify a generalized multiplane mass sheet degeneracy, in which the effective shear and convergence are sums over the lensing planes with specific, redshift-dependent weighting factors.},

	Abstract = {We present optical and near-IR imaging and spectroscopy of SGAS J105039.6+001730, a strongly lensed galaxy at z = 3.6252 magnified by >30×, and derive its physical properties. We measure a stellar mass of log(M */M &sun;) = 9.5 $\pm$ 0.35, star formation rates from [O II] lambdalambda3727 and Hbeta of 55 $\pm$ 25 and 84 $\pm$ 24 M &sun; yr-1, respectively, an electron density of ne <= 103 cm-2, an electron temperature of Te <= 14,000 K, and a metallicity of 12 + log(O/H) = 8.3 $\pm$ 0.1. The strong C  III] lambdalambda1907,1909 emission and abundance ratios of C, N, O, and Si are consistent with well-studied starbursts at z ~ 0 with similar metallicities. Strong P Cygni lines and He II lambda1640 emission indicate a significant population of Wolf-Rayet stars, but synthetic spectra of individual populations of young, hot stars do not reproduce the observed integrated P Cygni absorption features. The rest-frame UV spectral features are indicative of a young starburst with high ionization, implying either (1) an ionization parameter significantly higher than suggested by rest-frame optical nebular lines, or (2) differences in one or both of the initial mass function and the properties of ionizing spectra of massive stars. We argue that the observed features are likely the result of a superposition of star forming regions with different physical properties. These results demonstrate the complexity of star formation on scales smaller than individual galaxies, and highlight the importance of systematic effects that result from smearing together the signatures of individual star forming regions within galaxies.

	Abstract = {We describe substantial changes to MultiDrizzle intended to allow users to easily and accurately align and combine HST images taken at multiple epochs, and even with different instruments. In the first part of this program, the correction of the time-dependent distortion of ACS was introduced into MultiDrizzle to pro- vide distortion corrections good to a few hundredths of a pixel level. Now, we are undertaking a more profound change in the underlying method that MultiDrizzle (and HST) use to represent astrometry and geometric distortion. As part of this change we have temporarily renamed MultiDrizzle as BetaDrizzle to avoid confusion between the programs. BetaDrizzle uses new simple extensions of the fits format that allow us to fully represent the ACS and WFC3 distortions in the header of the image, meaning that a calibrated image needs no other files to describe its astrometry. Users will also be able to easily pass astrometric header information to each other or back to the archive for use by others. The presence of the full astrometric solution in the header means that users can fit the astrometry of one image to another image, or to an external catalog, without drizzling the image. Precise coordinate information can be extracted directly from the .flt image itself.},

	Abstract = {We present a detailed mass reconstruction and a novel study on the substructure properties in the core of the CLASH and Frontier Fields galaxy cluster MACS J0416.1-2403. We show and employ our extensive spectroscopic data set taken with the VIMOS instrument as part of our CLASH-VLT program, to confirm spectroscopically 10 strong lensing systems and to select a sample of 175 plausible cluster members to a limiting stellar mass of log(M_*/M_Sun) ~ 8.6. We reproduce the measured positions of 30 multiple images with a remarkable median offset of only 0.3" by means of a comprehensive strong lensing model comprised of 2 cluster dark-matter halos, represented by cored elliptical pseudo-isothermal mass distributions, and the cluster member components. The latter have total mass-to-light ratios increasing with the galaxy HST/WFC3 near-IR (F160W) luminosities. The measurement of the total enclosed mass within the Einstein radius is accurate to ~5%, including systematic uncertainties. We emphasize that the use of multiple-image systems with spectroscopic redshifts and knowledge of cluster membership based on extensive spectroscopic information is key to constructing robust high-resolution mass maps. We also produce magnification maps over the central area that is covered with HST observations. We investigate the galaxy contribution, both in terms of total and stellar mass, to the total mass budget of the cluster. When compared with the outcomes of cosmological $N$-body simulations, our results point to a lack of massive subhalos in the inner regions of simulated clusters with total masses similar to that of MACS J0416.1-2403. Our findings of the location and shape of the cluster dark-matter halo density profiles and on the cluster substructures provide intriguing tests of the assumed collisionless, cold nature of dark matter and of the role played by baryons in the process of structure formation.},

	Abstract = {Observations have set the first constraints on the epoch of reionization (EoR), corresponding to the formation epoch of the first luminous objects. Studies of Gunn-Peterson (GP) absorption indicate a rapid increase in the neutral fraction of the intergalactic medium (IGM) from xHI < 10 4 at z <= 5.5, to xHI > 10 3, perhaps up to 0.1, at z 6, while the large scale polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) implies a significant ionization fraction extending to higher redshifts, z 11 $\pm$ 3. These results, as well as observations of galaxy populations, suggest that reionization is a process that begins as early as z 14, and ends with the "percolation" phase at z 6 to 8. Low luminosity star-forming galaxies are likely the dominant sources of reionizing photons. Future low-frequency radio telescopes will make direct measurements of HI 21-cm emission from the neutral IGM during the EoR, and measurements of secondary CMB temperature anisotropy will provide details of the dynamics of the reionized IGM.},

	Abstract = {We present the weak lensing analysis of the Wide-Field Imager Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Cluster of Galaxy (WISCy) sample, a set of 12 clusters of galaxies selected for their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. After developing new and improved methods for background selection and determination of geometric lensing scaling factors from absolute multiband photometry in cluster fields, we compare the weak lensing mass estimate with public X-ray and SZ data. We find consistency with hydrostatic X-ray masses with no significant bias, no mass dependent bias and less than 20 per cent intrinsic scatter and constrain f_{{gas},500c}=0.128^{+0.029}_{-0.023}. We independently calibrate the South Pole Telescope significance-mass relation and find consistency with previous results. The comparison of weak lensing mass and Planck Compton parameters, whether extracted self-consistently with a mass-observable relation (MOR) or using X-ray prior information on cluster size, shows significant discrepancies. The deviations from the MOR strongly correlate with cluster mass and redshift. This could be explained either by a significantly shallower than expected slope of Compton decrement versus mass and a corresponding problem in the previous X-ray based mass calibration, or a size or redshift dependent bias in SZ signal extraction.},

	Abstract = {We present a strong lens analysis of SDSS J1004+4112, a unique quasar lens produced by a massive cluster of galaxies at z = 0.68, using newly developed software for gravitational lensing. We find that our parametric mass model well reproduces all observations, including the positions of quasar images as well as those of multiply imaged galaxies with measured spectroscopic redshifts, time delays between quasar images, and the positions of faint central images. The predicted large total magnification of mu ˜ 70 suggests that the lens system is indeed a useful site for studying the fine structure of a distant quasar and its host galaxy. The dark halo component is found to be unimodal, centered on the brightest cluster galaxy and the Chandra X-ray surface brightness profile. In addition, the orientation of the halo component is quite consistent with those of the brightest cluster galaxy and member galaxy distribution, implying that the lensing cluster is a relaxed system. The radial profile of the best-fit mass model is in good agreement with a mass profile inferred from the X-ray observation. While the inner radial slope of the dark halo component is consistent with being -1, a clear dependence of the predicted A-D time delay on the slope indicates that an additional time-delay measurement will improve constraints on the mass model.},

	Abstract = {Formation of galaxy clusters corresponds to the collapse of the largest gravitationally bound overdensities in the initial density field and is accompanied by the most energetic phenomena since the Big Bang and by the complex interplay between gravity-induced dynamics of collapse and baryonic processes associated with galaxy formation. Galaxy clusters are, thus, at the cross-roads of cosmology and astrophysics and are unique laboratories for testing models of gravitational structure formation, galaxy evolution, thermodynamics of the intergalactic medium, and plasma physics. At the same time, their large masses make them a useful probe of growth of structure over cosmological time, thus providing cosmological constraints that are complementary to other probes. In this review, we describe our current understanding of cluster formation: from the general picture of collapse from initial density fluctuations in an expanding Universe to detailed simulations of cluster formation including the effects of galaxy formation. We outline both the areas in which highly accurate predictions of theoretical models can be obtained and areas where predictions are uncertain due to uncertain physics of galaxy formation and feedback. The former includes the description of the structural properties of the dark matter halos hosting clusters, their mass function, and clustering properties. Their study provides a foundation for cosmological applications of clusters and for testing the fundamental assumptions of the standard model of structure formation. The latter includes the description of the total gas and stellar fractions and the thermodynamical and nonthermal processes in the intracluster plasma. Their study serves as a testing ground for galaxy formation models and plasma physics. In this context, we identify a suitable radial range where the observed thermal properties of the intracluster plasma exhibit the most regular behavior and, thus, can be used to define robust observational proxies for the total cluster mass. Finally, we discuss the formation of clusters in nonstandard cosmological models, such as non-Gaussian models for the initial density field and models with modified gravity, along with prospects for testing these alternative scenarios with large cluster surveys in the near future.},

	Abstract = {Despite consistent progress in numerical simulations, the observable properties of galaxy clusters are difficult to predict ab initio. It is therefore important to compare both theoretical and observational results to a direct measure of the cluster mass. This can be done by measuring the gravitational lensing effects caused by the bending of light by the cluster mass distribution. In this review we discuss how this phenomenon can be used to determine cluster masses and study the mass distribution itself. As sample sizes increase, the accuracy of the weak lensing mass estimates needs to improve accordingly. We discuss the main practical aspects of these measurements. We review a number of applications and highlight some recent results.},

	Abstract = {Well-calibrated scaling relations between the observable properties and the total masses of clusters of galaxies are important for understanding the physical processes that give rise to these relations. They are also a critical ingredient for studies that aim to constrain cosmological parameters using galaxy clusters. For this reason much effort has been spent during the last decade to better understand and interpret relations of the properties of the intra-cluster medium. Improved X-ray data have expanded the mass range down to galaxy groups, whereas SZ surveys have opened a new observational window on the intracluster medium. In addition, continued progress in the performance of cosmological simulations has allowed a better understanding of the physical processes and selection effects affecting the observed scaling relations. Here we review the recent literature on various scaling relations, focussing on the latest observational measurements and the progress in our understanding of the deviations from self similarity.},

A theoretical basis that describes clusters as massive, multicomponent, quasi-equilibrium systems is growing in its capability to interpret multiwavelength observations of expanding scope and sensitivity. We review current cosmological results, including contributions to fundamental physics, obtained from observations of galaxy clusters. These results are consistent with and complementary to those from other methods. We highlight several areas of opportunity for the next few years, and emphasize the need for accurate modeling of survey selection and sources of systematic error. Capitalizing on these opportunities will require a multiwavelength approach and the application of rigorous statistical frameworks, utilizing the combined strengths of observers, simulators, and theorists.},

	Abstract = {Deep Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) imaging of the most powerful lensing clusters provides access to the most magnified distant galaxies. It is a challenge to construct lens models capable of describing these complex massive, merging clusters so that the intrinsic source properties can be meaningfully derived. Here we apply our general free-form lensing method (WSLAP+) to A2744, providing a model independent map of the cluster magnification and geometric distance estimates to multiply-lensed sources. We solve simultaneously for a smooth cluster component on a pixel grid, together with local deflections by the observed member galaxies. Our solution is sufficiently accurate to securely identify 18 multiply-lensed systems behind A2744 totaling 56 images, spanning 1.0<z<7.5. Our model corrects and complete several systems recently claimed using the same data. The reconstructed mass shows a small enhancement in the direction where significant amounts of hot plasma can be seen in X-rays. We compare photometric redshift estimates with "geometric redshifts", derived from the relative angles between the multiple images, finding tight agreement and consistency with the standard cosmological parameters. Predicted and observed magnitudes were found to agree with each other in general, but further refinement in the lens model is required such that the magnification can be accurately corrected. Intriguingly, no multiply-lensed galaxy is detected beyond z=7.5, despite the high magnification and the limiting redshift of z=11.5 permitted by the HFF filters. With the additional HFF clusters we can better examine the plausibility of any pronounced high-z deficit, averaging over clustering noise, with potentially important implications for the epoch of reionization and the nature of dark matter.},

	Abstract = {We report the detection of a 4 h-170 Mpc long large-scale filament leading into the massive galaxy cluster MACS J0717.5+3745. The extent of this object well beyond the cluster's nominal virial radius (~2.3 Mpc) rules out prior interaction between its constituent galaxies and the cluster and makes it a prime candidate for a genuine filament as opposed to a merger remnant or a double cluster. The structure was discovered as a pronounced overdensity of galaxies selected to have V-R colors close to the cluster red sequence. Extensive spectroscopic follow-up of over 300 of these galaxies in a region covering the filament and the cluster confirms that the entire structure is located at the cluster redshift of z=0.545. Featuring galaxy surface densities of typically 15 Mpc-2 down to luminosities of 0.13L*V, the most diffuse parts of the filament are comparable in density to the clumps of red galaxies found around A851 in the only similar study carried out to date (Kodama et al.). Our direct detection of an extended large-scale filament funneling matter onto a massive distant cluster provides a superb target for in-depth studies of the evolution of galaxies in environments of greatly varying density and supports the predictions from theoretical models and numerical simulations of structure formation in a hierarchical picture.

	Abstract = {We report observations of three gravitationally lensed supernovae (SNe) in the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH) Multi-Cycle Treasury program. These objects, SN CLO12Car (z = 1.28), SN CLN12Did (z = 0.85), and SN CLA11Tib (z = 1.14), are located behind three different clusters, MACSJ1720.2+3536 (z = 0.391), RXJ1532.9+3021 (z = 0.345), and A383 (z = 0.187), respectively. Each SN was detected in Hubble Space Telescope optical and infrared images. Based on photometric classification, we find that SNe CLO12Car and CLN12Did are likely to be Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), while the classification of SN CLA11Tib is inconclusive. Using multi-color light-curve fits to determine a standardized SN Ia luminosity distance, we infer that SN CLO12Car was ~1.0 $\pm$ 0.2 mag brighter than field SNe Ia at a similar redshift and ascribe this to gravitational lens magnification. Similarly, SN CLN12Did is ~0.2 $\pm$ 0.2 mag brighter than field SNe Ia. We derive independent estimates of the predicted magnification from CLASH strong+weak-lensing maps of the clusters (in magnitude units, 2.5 log10mu): 0.83 $\pm$ 0.16 mag for SN CLO12Car, 0.28 $\pm$ 0.08 mag for SN CLN12Did, and 0.43 $\pm$ 0.11 mag for SN CLA11Tib. The two SNe Ia provide a new test of the cluster lens model predictions: we find that the magnifications based on the SN Ia brightness and those predicted by the lens maps are consistent. Our results herald the promise of future observations of samples of cluster-lensed SNe Ia (from the ground or space) to help illuminate the dark-matter distribution in clusters of galaxies, through the direct determination of absolute magnifications.},

@article{Nordin:2014qe,
	Abstract = {Using three magnified Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) detected behind CLASH (Cluster Lensing and Supernovae with Hubble) clusters, we perform a first pilot study to see whether standardizable candles can be used to calibrate cluster mass maps created from strong lensing observations. Such calibrations will be crucial when next-generation Hubble Space Telescope cluster surveys (e.g. Frontier) provide magnification maps that will, in turn, form the basis for the exploration of the high-redshift Universe. We classify SNe using combined photometric and spectroscopic observations, finding two of the three to be clearly of Type Ia and the third probable. The SNe exhibit significant amplification, up to a factor of 1.7 at ˜5sigma significance (SN-L2). We conducted this as a blind study to avoid fine-tuning of parameters, finding a mean amplification difference between SNe and the cluster lensing models of 0.09 $\pm$ 0.09stat $\pm$ 0.05sys mag. This impressive agreement suggests no tension between cluster mass models and high-redshift-standardized SNe Ia. However, the measured statistical dispersion of sigmamu = 0.21 mag appeared large compared to the dispersion expected based on statistical uncertainties (0.14). Further work with the SN and cluster lensing models, post-unblinding, reduced the measured dispersion to sigmamu = 0.12. An explicit choice should thus be made as to whether SNe are used unblinded to improve the model, or blinded to test the model. As the lensed SN samples grow larger, this technique will allow improved constraints on assumptions regarding e.g. the structure of the dark matter halo.},

	Abstract = {The Hubble Frontier Fields program combines the capabilities of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) with the gravitational lensing of massive galaxy clusters to probe the distant universe to an unprecedented depth. Here, we present the results of the first combined HST and Spitzer observations of the cluster A-2744. We combine the full near-infrared data with ancillary optical images to search for gravitationally lensed high-redshift (z >~ 6) galaxies. We report the detection of 15 I 814 dropout candidates at z ~ 6-7 and one Y 105 dropout at z ~ 8 in a total survey area of 1.43 arcmin2 in the source plane. The predictions of our lens model also allow us to identify five multiply imaged systems lying at redshifts between z ~ 6 and z ~ 8. Thanks to constraints from the mass distribution in the cluster, we were able to estimate the effective survey volume corrected for completeness and magnification effects. This was in turn used to estimate the rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity function (LF) at z ~ 6-8. Our LF results are generally in agreement with the most recent blank field estimates, confirming the feasibility of surveys through lensing clusters. Although based on a shallower observations than what will be achieved in the final data set including the full Advanced Camera for Survey observations, the LF presented here goes down to M UV ~--18.5, corresponding to 0.2L sstarf at z ~ 7 with one identified object at M UV ~--15 thanks to the highly magnified survey areas. This early study forecasts the power of using massive galaxy clusters as cosmic telescopes and its complementarity to blank fields.  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope (HST), which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are associated with programs 13495 and 11689. Based in part on observations made with the Spitzer Space Telescope, which is operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with NASA. This work utilizes gravitational lensing models produced by PIs Ebeling, Merten, and Zitrin, and Sharon funded as part of the HST Frontier Fields program conducted by STScI.

	Abstract = {In Paper I we presented a methodology to recover the spatial variations of properties of the intracluster gas from ASCA X-ray satellite observations of galaxy clusters. We verified the correctness of this procedure by applying it to simulated cluster data sets that we had subjected to the various contaminants common in ASCA data. In this paper we present the results that we obtain when we apply this method to real galaxy cluster observations. We determine broad-band temperature and cooling-flow mass-deposition rates for the 106 clusters in our sample, and obtain temperature, abundance and emissivity profiles (i.e., at least two annular bins) for 98 of these clusters. We find that 90per cent of these temperature profiles are consistent with isothermality at the 3sigma confidence level. This conflicts with the prevalence of steeply declining cluster temperature profiles found by Markevitch et al. from a sample of 30 clusters.},

	Abstract = {We present the catalogue of the REFLEX Cluster Survey providing information on the X-ray properties, redshifts, and some identification details of the clusters in the REFLEX sample. The catalogue describes a statistically complete X-ray flux-limited sample of 447 galaxy clusters above an X-ray flux of 3 × 10-12 erg s-1 cm-2 (0.1 to 2.4 keV) in an area of 4.24 ster in the southern sky. The cluster candidates were first selected by their X-ray emission in the ROSAT-All Sky Survey and subsequently spectroscopically identified in the frame of an ESO key programme. Previously described tests have shown that the sample is more than 90% complete and there is a conservative upper limit of 9% on the fraction of clusters with a dominant X-ray contamination from AGN. In addition to the cluster catalogue we also describe the complete selection criteria as a function of the sky position and the conversion functions used to analyse the X-ray data. These are essential for the precise statistical analysis of the large-scale cluster distribution. This data set is at present the largest, statistically complete X-ray galaxy cluster sample. Together with these data set we also provide for the first time the full three-dimensional selection function. The sample forms the basis of several cosmological studies, one of the most important applications being the assessment of the statistics of the large-scale structure of the universe and the test of cosmological models. Part of these cosmological results have already been published.  Based on observations at the European Southern Observatory La Silla, Chile.

	Abstract = {New Chandra X-ray data and extensive optical spectroscopy, obtained with AAOmega on the 3.9 m Anglo-Australian Telescope, are used to study the complex merger taking place in the galaxy cluster Abell 2744. Combining our spectra with data from the literature provides a catalog of 1237 redshifts for extragalactic objects lying within 15' of the cluster center. From these, we confirm 343 cluster members projected within 3 Mpc of the cluster center. Combining positions and velocities, we identify two major substructures, corresponding to the remnants of two major subclusters. The new data are consistent with a post-core-passage, major merger taking place along an axis that is tilted well out of the plane of the sky, together with an interloping minor merger. Supporting this interpretation, the new X-ray data reveal enriched, low entropy gas from the core of the approaching, major subcluster, lying ~2' north of the cluster center, and a shock front to the southeast of the previously known bright, compact core associated with the receding subcluster. The X-ray morphology of the compact core is consistent with a Bullet-like cluster viewed from within ~45$\,^{\circ}$ of the merger axis. An X-ray peak ~3' northwest of the cluster center, with an associated cold front to the northeast and a trail of low entropy gas to the south, is interpreted as the remnant of an interloping minor merger taking place roughly in the plane of the sky. We infer approximate paths for the three merging components.},

	Abstract = {The Inamori-Magellan Areal Camera and Spectrograph (IMACS) is a wide-field, multipurpose imaging spectrograph on the Magellan-Baade telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. IMACS has two channels-f/2 and f/4, each with an 8K×8K pixel mosaic of CCD detectors, that service the widest range of capabilities of any major spectrograph. These include wide-field imaging at two scales, 0.20" pixel and 0.11" pixel, single-object and multislit spectroscopy, integral-field spectroscopy with two 5"×7" areas sampled at 0.20" pixel (Durham IFU), a multiobject echelle (MOE) capable of N˜10 simultaneous full-wavelength R≈20,000 spectra, the Maryland-Magellan Tunable Filter (MMTF), and an image-slicing reformatter for dense-pack multislit work (GISMO). Spectral resolutions of 8<R<5000 are available through a combination of prisms, grisms, and gratings, and most modes are instantly available in any given IMACS configuration. IMACS has a spectroscopic efficiency over 50% in f/2 multislit mode (instrument only) and, by the AOmega figure of merit (telescope primary surface area times instrument field of view ), IMACS scores 5.7 m deg, compared with 3.1 for VIMOS on VLT3 and with 2.0 for DEIMOS on Keck2. IMACS is the most versatile, and-for wide-field optical spectroscopy-the most powerful spectrograph on the planet.},

	Abstract = {We present a comprehensive analysis of z > 8 galaxies based on ultra-deep WFC3/IR data. We exploit all the WFC3/IR imaging over the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field from the HUDF09 and the new HUDF12 program, in addition to the HUDF09 parallel field data, as well as wider area imaging over GOODS-South. Galaxies are selected based on the Lyman break technique in three samples centered around z ~ 9, z ~ 10, and z ~ 11, with seven z ~ 9 galaxy candidates, and one each at z ~ 10 and z ~ 11. We confirm a new z ~ 10 candidate (with z = 9.8 $\pm$ 0.6) that was not convincingly identified in our first z ~ 10 sample. Using these candidates, we perform one of the first estimates of the z ~ 9 UV luminosity function (LF) and improve our previous constraints at z ~ 10. Extrapolating the lower redshift UV LF evolution should have revealed 17 z ~ 9 and 9 z ~ 10 sources, i.e., a factor ~3 × and 9× larger than observed. The inferred star formation rate density (SFRD) in galaxies above 0.7 M &sun; yr-1 decreases by 0.6 $\pm$ 0.2 dex from z ~ 8 to z ~ 9, in excellent agreement with previous estimates. From a combination of all current measurements, we find a best estimate of a factor 10× decrease in the SFRD from z ~ 8 to z ~ 10, following (1 + z)-11.4 $\pm$ 3.1. Our measurements thus confirm our previous finding of an accelerated evolution beyond z ~ 8, and signify a very rapid build-up of galaxies with M UV < -17.7 mag within only ~200 Myr from z ~ 10 to z ~ 8, in the heart of cosmic reionization.

@article{Finkelstein:2012bh,
	Abstract = {We present measurements of the specific ultraviolet luminosity density from a sample of 483 galaxies at 6 <~ z <~ 8. These galaxies were selected from new deep near-infrared Hubble Space Telescope imaging from the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey, Hubble UltraDeep Field 2009, and Wide Field Camera 3 Early Release Science programs. We investigate the contribution to reionization from galaxies that we observe directly, thus sidestepping the uncertainties inherent in complementary studies that have invoked assumptions regarding the intrinsic shape or the faint-end cutoff of the galaxy ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function. Due to our larger survey volume, wider wavelength coverage, and updated assumptions about the clumping of gas in the intergalactic medium (IGM), we find that the observable population of galaxies can sustain a fully reionized IGM at z = 6, if the average ionizing photon escape fraction (f esc) is ~30%. Our result contrasts with a number of previous studies that have measured UV luminosity densities at these redshifts that vary by a factor of five, with many concluding that galaxies could not complete reionization by z = 6 unless a large population of galaxies fainter than the detection limit were invoked, or extremely high values of f esc were present. The specific UV luminosity density from our observed galaxy samples at z = 7 and 8 is not sufficient to maintain a fully reionized IGM unless f esc > 50%. We examine the contribution from galaxies in different luminosity ranges and find that the sub-L* galaxies we detect are stronger contributors to the ionizing photon budget than the L > L* population, unless f esc is luminosity dependent. Combining our observations with constraints on the emission rate of ionizing photons from Lyalpha forest observations at z = 6, we find that we can constrain f esc < 34% (2sigma) if the observed galaxies are the only contributors to reionization, or <13% (2sigma) if the luminosity function extends to a limiting magnitude of M UV = -13. These escape fractions are sufficient to sustain an ionized IGM by z = 6. Current constraints on the high-redshift galaxy population imply that the volume ionized fraction of the IGM, while consistent with unity at z <= 6, appears to drop at redshifts not much higher than 7, consistent with a number of complementary reionization probes. If faint galaxies dominated the ionizing photon budget at z = 6-7, future extremely deep observations with the James Webb Space Telescope will probe deep enough to directly observe them, providing an indirect constraint on the global ionizing photon escape fraction.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of the deepest search to date for star-forming galaxies beyond a redshift z ~= 8.5 utilizing a new sequence of near-infrared Wide-Field Camera 3 (WFC3/IR) images of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UDF). This "UDF12" campaign completed in 2012 September doubles the earlier exposures with WFC3/IR in this field and quadruples the exposure in the key F105W filter used to locate such distant galaxies. Combined with additional imaging in the F140W filter, the fidelity of high-redshift candidates is greatly improved. Using spectral energy distribution fitting techniques on objects selected from a deep multi-band near-infrared stack, we find seven promising z > 8.5 candidates. As none of the previously claimed UDF candidates with 8.5 < z < 10 are confirmed by our deeper multi-band imaging, our campaign has transformed the measured abundance of galaxies in this redshift range. Although we recover the candidate UDFj-39546284 (previously proposed at z = 10.3), it is undetected in the newly added F140W image, implying that it lies at z = 11.9 or is an intense emission line galaxy at z ~= 2.4. Although no physically plausible model can explain the required line intensity given the lack of Lyalpha or broadband UV signal, without an infrared spectrum we cannot rule out an exotic interloper. Regardless, our robust z ~= 8.5-10 sample demonstrates a luminosity density that continues the smooth decline observed over 6 < z < 8. Such continuity has important implications for models of cosmic reionization and future searches for z >10 galaxies with James Webb Space Telescope.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of a systematic search for galaxies in the redshift range z = 6-9, within the new, deep, near-infrared (Y, J, H) imaging of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field provided by the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on the Hubble Space Telescope. We have performed full spectral energy distribution fitting to the optical+infrared photometry of all high-redshift galaxy candidates detected at >=5sigma significance in at least one of the WFC3/IR broad-band filters. After careful rejection of contaminants, the result is a sample of 49 galaxies with primary photometric redshift solutions z > 5.9, within the 4.5 arcmin2 field covered by the new near-infrared imaging. Our sample, selected without recourse to specific colour cuts, reselects all but the faintest one of the 16 z850-drops selected by Oesch et al., recovers all five of the Y105-drops reported by Bouwens et al. and adds a further 29 equally plausible galaxy candidates, of which 12 lie beyond z ~= 6.3 and four lie beyond z ~= 7.0. However, we also present confidence intervals on our photometric redshift estimates, including alternative secondary redshift solutions. As a result of this analysis, we caution that acceptable low-redshift (z < 2) solutions exist for 28 out of the 37 galaxies at z > 6.3 and in particular for all eight of the galaxy candidates reported here at z > 7.5. Nevertheless, we note that the very highest redshift candidates appear to be strongly clustered in the field. Based on our photometric redshift analysis, we derive new estimates of the ultraviolet galaxy luminosity function at z ~= 7 and 8. Where our results are most robust, at a characteristic luminosity M1500 ~= -19.5 (AB), we find that the comoving number density of galaxies declines by a factor of ~=2.5 between z ~= 6 and 7 and by a further factor of ~=2 by z ~= 8. These results suggest that it is difficult for the observed population of high-redshift star-forming galaxies to achieve re-ionization by z ~= 6 without a significant contribution from galaxies well below the detection limits, plus alterations in the escape fraction of ionizing photons and/or continued vigorous star formation at z > 15.},

	Abstract = {We utilize the newly acquired, ultra-deep WFC3/IR observations over the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) to search for star-forming galaxies at z ~ 8-8.5, only 600 million years from recombination, using a Y 105-dropout selection. The new 4.7 arcmin2 WFC3/IR observations reach to ~28.8 AB mag (5sigma) in the Y 105 J 125 H 160 bands. These remarkable data reach ~1.5 AB mag deeper than the previous data over the HUDF, and now are an excellent match to the HUDF optical ACS data. For our search criteria, we use a two-color Lyman break selection technique to identify z ~ 8-8.5Y 105-dropouts. We find five likely z ~ 8-8.5 candidates. The sources have H 160-band magnitudes of ~28.3 AB mag and very blue UV-continuum slopes, with a median estimated beta of lsim-2.5 (where f lambda vprop lambdabeta). This suggests that z ~ 8 galaxies are not only essentially dust free but also may have very young ages or low metallicities. The observed number of Y 105-dropout candidates is smaller than the 20 $\pm$ 6 sources expected assuming no evolution from z ~ 6, but is consistent with the five expected extrapolating the Bouwens et al. luminosity function (LF) results to z ~ 8. These results provide evidence that the evolution in the LF seen from z ~ 7 to z ~ 3 continues to z ~ 8. The remarkable improvement in the sensitivity of WFC3/IR has enabled Hubble Space Telescope to cross a threshold, revealing star-forming galaxies at z~ 8-9.

	Abstract = {We present a parametric strong lensing model of the cluster Abell 2218 based on HST ACS data. We constrain the lens model using 8 previously known multiply imaged systems, of which 7 have spectroscopically confirmed redshifts. In addition, we propose five candidate multiply imaged systems and estimate their redshifts using our mass model. The model parameters are optimized in the source plane by a bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain as implemented in the the publicly available software Lenstool. We find rms=0."12 for the scatter of the sources in the source plane, which translates into rms=1."49 between the predicted and measured image positions in the image plane. We find that the projected mass distribution of Abell 2218 is bimodal, which is supported by an analysis of the light distribution. We also find evidence for two structures in velocity space, separated by ~1000 km/s, corresponding to the two large scale dark matter clumps. We find that the lensing constraints can not be well reproduced using only dark matter halos associated with the cluster galaxies, but that the dark matter is required to be smoothly distributed in large scale halos. At 100" the enclosed projected mass is 3.8e14 solar masses. At that radius, the large scale halos contribute ~85% of the mass. We find that the model is not very sensitive to the fainter galaxy sized halos, unless they locally perturb a given multiply imaged system. Therefore, dark galaxy sized substructure can be reliably constrained only if it locally perturbs one of the systems. In an appendix we give a self-contained description of the parametric profile we use, the dual pseudo isothermal elliptical mass distribution (dPIE). This profile is a two component pseudo isothermal mass distribution (PIEMD) with both a core radii and a scale radii. (Abridged)},

	Abstract = {Using CHANDRA, we investigate the spatial temperature distribution of the intracluster medium (ICM) within 700 kpc of the center of the massive merging cluster MACSJ0717.5+3745 at z = 0.55. Combining the X-ray evidence with information about the distribution and velocities of the cluster galaxies near the core provides us with a snapshot of the three-dimensional geometry and dynamics of one of the most complex clusters studied to date. We find MACSJ0717.5+3745 to be an active triple merger with ICM temperatures exceeding 20 keV. Although radial velocity information and X-ray/optical offsets indicate that all three mergers proceed along distinctly different directions, the partial alignment of the merger axes points to a common origin in the large-scale filament south-east of the cluster core. Clear decrements in the ICM temperature observed near two of these subclusters identify the respective X-ray surface brightness peaks as remnants of cool cores; the compactness and low temperature of 5.7 keV of one of these features suggest that the respective merger, a high-velocity collision at 3,000 km s-1, is still in its very early stages. Looking beyond the triple merger, we find the large-scale filament to not only provide a spatial as well as temporal arrow for the interpretation of the dynamics of the merger events near the cluster core, but we also find tantalizing, if circumstantial, evidence for direct, large-scale heating of the ICM by contiguous infall of low-density gas from the filament.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of a simple but robust morphological classification of a statistically complete sample of 108 of the most X-ray-luminous clusters at 0.15 <=z<= 0.7 observed with Chandra. Our aims are to (a) identify the most disturbed massive clusters to be used as gravitational lenses for studies of the distant Universe and as probes of particle acceleration mechanisms resulting in non-thermal radio emission; (b) find cluster mergers featuring subcluster trajectories that make them suitable for quantitative analyses of cluster collisions; and (c) constrain the evolution with redshift of the cluster merger fraction. Finally, (d) this paper represents the third public release of clusters from the MAssive Cluster Survey sample, adding 24 clusters to the 46 published previously. To classify clusters by the degree of relaxation, we use the projected offset of the brightest cluster galaxy from the peak (or the global centroid) of the X-ray emission as a measure of the segregation between the intracluster gas and dark matter, and also perform a visual assessment of the optical and X-ray morphology on all scales. Regarding (a), we identify 10 complex systems likely to have undergone multiple merger events in the recent past. Regarding (b), we identify 11 systems likely to be post-collision, binary, head-on mergers (BHOMs), as well as another six mergers that are possible BHOMs but probably harder to interpret because of non-negligible impact parameters and merger axes closer to our line of sight. Regarding (c), we find a highly significant increase with redshift in the fraction of morphologically disturbed clusters (and thus a clear decrease in the number of fully relaxed systems) starting at z˜ 0.4, in spite of a detection bias in our sample against very disturbed systems at high redshift. Since our morphological diagnostics are all based on imaging data and thus sensitive to projection effects, the measured merger fractions should be considered lower limits and our list of mergers incomplete, as we are likely to miss systems forming along axes close to our line of sight. A larger sample of clusters with high-quality X-ray data in particular at high redshift will be needed to trace the evolutionary history of cluster growth and relaxation closer to the primary epoch of cluster formation z˜ 1.},

	Abstract = {We describe the design and current status of a new X-ray cluster survey aimed at the compilation of a statistically complete sample of very X-ray luminous (and thus, by inference, massive), distant clusters of galaxies. The primary goal of the Massive Cluster Survey (MACS) is to increase the number of known massive clusters at z>0.3 from a handful to hundreds. Upon completion of the survey, the MACS cluster sample will greatly improve our ability to study quantitatively the physical and cosmological parameters driving cluster evolution at redshifts and luminosities poorly sampled by all existing surveys. To achieve these goals, we apply an X-ray flux and X-ray hardness ratio cut to select distant cluster candidates from the ROSAT Bright Source Catalogue. Starting from a list of more than 5000 X-ray sources within the survey area of 22,735 deg2, we use positional cross-correlations with public catalogs of Galactic and extragalactic objects, reference to Automated Plate Measuring Machine (APM) colors, visual inspection of Digitized Sky Survey images, extensive CCD imaging, and finally spectroscopic observations with the University of Hawaii's 2.2 m and the Keck 10 m telescopes to compile the final cluster sample. We discuss in detail the X-ray selection procedure and the resulting selection function and present model predictions for the number of distant clusters expected to emerge from MACS. At the time of this writing the MACS cluster sample comprises 101 spectroscopically confirmed clusters at 0.3<=z<=0.6 more than two-thirds of these are new discoveries. Our preliminary sample is already 15 times larger than that of the EMSS in the same redshift and X-ray luminosity range.},

	Abstract = {Merging clusters of galaxies are unique in their power to directly probe and place limits on the self-interaction cross-section of dark matter. Detailed observations of several merging clusters have shown the intracluster gas to be displaced from the centroids of dark matter and galaxy density by ram pressure, while the latter components are spatially coincident, consistent with collisionless dark matter. This has been used to place upper limits on the dark matter particle self-interaction cross-section of order 1 cm2 g-1. The cluster A520 has been seen as a possible exception. We revisit A520 presenting new Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys mosaic images and a Magellan image set. We perform a detailed weak-lensing analysis and show that the weak-lensing mass measurements and morphologies of the core galaxy-filled structures are mostly in good agreement with previous works. There is, however, one significant difference: We do not detect the previously claimed "dark core" that contains excess mass with no significant galaxy overdensity at the location of the X-ray plasma. This peak has been suggested to be indicative of a large self-interaction cross-section for dark matter (at least ~5sigma larger than the upper limit of 0.7 cm2 g-1 determined by observations of the Bullet Cluster). We find no such indication and instead find that the mass distribution of A520, after subtraction of the X-ray plasma mass, is in good agreement with the luminosity distribution of the cluster galaxies. We conclude that A520 shows no evidence to contradict the collisionless dark matter scenario.  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are associated with program 12253.  This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.},

	Abstract = {We constrain the physical nature of dark matter using the newly identified massive merging galaxy cluster MACS J0025.4-1222. As was previously shown by the example of the Bullet Cluster (1E 0657-56), such systems are ideal laboratories for detecting isolated dark matter and distinguishing between cold dark matter (CDM) and other scenarios (e.g., self-interacting dark matter, alternative gravity theories). MACS J0025.4-1222 consists of two merging subclusters of similar richness at z=0.586. We measure the distribution of X-ray-emitting gas from Chandra X-ray data and find it to be clearly displaced from the distribution of galaxies. A strong (information from highly distorted arcs) and weak (using weakly distorted background galaxies) gravitational lensing analysis based on Hubble Space Telescope observations and Keck arc spectroscopy confirms that the subclusters have near-equal mass. The total mass distribution in each of the subclusters is clearly offset (at >4 sigma significance) from the peak of the hot X-ray-emitting gas (the main baryonic component) but aligned with the distribution of galaxies. We measure the fractions of mass in hot gas (0.09+0.07-0.03) and stars (0.010+0.007-0.004), consistent with those of typical clusters, finding that dark matter is the dominant contributor to the gravitational field. Under the assumption that the subclusters experienced a head-on collision in the plane of the sky, we obtain an order-of-magnitude estimate of the dark matter self-interaction cross section of sigma/m<4 cm2 g-1, reaffirming the results from the Bullet Cluster on the collisionless nature of dark matter.  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are associated with programs GO11100 and GO10703. This work is also based on observations collected at the W. M. Keck Observatory.},

	Abstract = {We present new weak-lensing observations of 1E 0657-558 (z=0.296), a unique cluster merger, that enable a direct detection of dark matter, independent of assumptions regarding the nature of the gravitational force law. Due to the collision of two clusters, the dissipationless stellar component and the fluid-like X-ray-emitting plasma are spatially segregated. By using both wide-field ground-based images and HST/ACS images of the cluster cores, we create gravitational lensing maps showing that the gravitational potential does not trace the plasma distribution, the dominant baryonic mass component, but rather approximately traces the distribution of galaxies. An 8 sigma significance spatial offset of the center of the total mass from the center of the baryonic mass peaks cannot be explained with an alteration of the gravitational force law and thus proves that the majority of the matter in the system is unseen.

@article{Clowe:2004uq,
	Abstract = {We present a weak-lensing mass reconstruction of the interacting cluster 1E 0657-558, in which we detect both the main cluster and a subcluster. The subcluster is identified as a smaller cluster that has just undergone initial infall and pass-through of the primary cluster and has been previously identified in both optical surveys and X-ray studies. The X-ray gas has been separated from the galaxies by ram pressure-stripping during the pass-through. The detected mass peak is located between the X-ray peak and galaxy concentration, although the position is consistent with the galaxy centroid within the errors of the mass reconstruction. We find that the mass peak for the main cluster is in good spatial agreement with the cluster galaxies and is offset from the X-ray halo at 3.4 sigma significance, and we determine that the mass-to-light ratios of the two components are consistent with those of relaxed clusters. The observed offsets of the lensing mass peaks from the peaks of the dominant visible mass component (the X-ray gas) directly demonstrate the presence, and dominance, of dark matter in this cluster. This proof of dark matter existence holds true even under the assumption of modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND); based on the observed gravitational shear-optical light ratios and the mass peak-X-ray gas offsets, the dark matter component in a MOND regime would have a total mass that is at least equal to the baryonic mass of the system.

	Abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of multi-wavelength Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) imaging and Keck/OSIRIS near-infrared adaptive optics-assisted integral field spectroscopy for a highly magnified lensed galaxy at z = 1.70. This young starburst is representative of ultraviolet-selected star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at z ~ 2 and contains multiple individual star-forming regions. Due to the lensing magnification, we can resolve spatial scales down to 100 pc in the source plane of the galaxy. The velocity field shows disturbed kinematics suggestive of an ongoing interaction and there is a clear signature of a tidal tail. We constrain the age, reddening, star formation rate, and stellar mass of the star-forming clumps from spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling of the WFC3 photometry and measure their Halpha luminosity, metallicity, and outflow properties from the OSIRIS data. With strong star-formation-driven outflows in four clumps, RCSGA0327 is the first high-redshift SFG at stellar mass <1010 M &sun; with spatially resolved stellar winds. We compare the Halpha luminosities, sizes, and dispersions of the star-forming regions with other high-z clumps as well as local giant H II regions and find no evidence for increased clump star formation surface densities in interacting systems, unlike in the local universe. Spatially resolved SED modeling unveils an established stellar population at the location of the largest clump and a second mass concentration near the edge of the system that is not detected in Halpha emission. This suggests a picture of an equal-mass mixed major merger, which has not triggered a new burst of star formation or caused a tidal tail in the gas-poor component.},

The resulting mass map is more circular in projection than the clumpy distribution of cluster galaxies, and the light is more concentrated than the mass within r<50 kpc h-1. The projected mass profile flattens steadily toward the center with a shallow mean slope of dlogSigma/dlogr~=-0.55+/-0.1, over the observed range r<250 kpc h-1, matching well an NFW profile, but with a relatively high concentration, Cvir=8.2+2.1-1.8. A softened isothermal profile (rcore=20+/-2") is not conclusively excluded, illustrating that lensing constrains only projected quantities. Regarding cosmology, we clearly detect the purely geometric increase of bend angles with redshift. The dependence on the cosmological parameters is weak owing to the proximity of A1689, z=0.18, constraining the locus, OmegaM+OmegaLambda<=1.2. This consistency with standard cosmology provides independent support for our model, because the redshift information is not required to derive an accurate mass map. Similarly, the relative fluxes of the multiple images are reproduced well by our best-fitting lens model.},

	Abstract = {We present an analysis of the line-of-sight structure toward a sample of 10 strong lensing cluster cores. Structure is traced by groups that are identified spectroscopically in the redshift range, 0.1 <= z <= 0.9, and we measure the projected angular and comoving separations between each group and the primary strong lensing clusters in each corresponding line of sight. From these data we measure the distribution of projected angular separations between the primary strong lensing clusters and uncorrelated large-scale structure as traced by groups. We then compare the observed distribution of angular separations for our strong lensing selected lines of sight against the distribution of groups that is predicted for clusters lying along random lines of sight. There is clear evidence for an excess of structure along the line of sight at small angular separations (theta <= 6') along the strong lensing selected lines of sight, indicating that uncorrelated structure is a significant systematic that contributes to producing galaxy clusters with large cross sections for strong lensing. The prevalence of line-of-sight structure is one of several biases in strong lensing clusters that can potentially be folded into cosmological measurements using galaxy cluster samples. These results also have implications for current and future studies---such as the Hubble Space Telescope Frontier Fields---that make use of massive galaxy cluster lenses as precision cosmological telescopes; it is essential that the contribution of line-of-sight structure be carefully accounted for in the strong lens modeling of the cluster lenses.

	Abstract = {In the course of our 870 mum APEX/LABOCA follow-up of the Herschel Lensing Survey we have detected a source in AS1063 (RXC J2248.7-4431) that has no counterparts in any of the Herschel PACS/SPIRE bands, it is a Herschel "drop-out" with S870/S500 >= 0.5. The 870 mum emission is extended and centered on the brightest cluster galaxy, suggesting either a multiply imaged background source or substructure in the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich increment due to inhomogeneities in the hot cluster gas of this merging cluster. We discuss both interpretations with emphasis on the putative lensed source. Based on the observed properties and on our lens model we find that this source may be the first submillimeter galaxy (SMG) with a moderate far-infrared (FIR) luminosity (LFIR < 1012 L&sun;) detected so far at z > 4. In deep HST observations we identified a multiply imaged z ~ 6 source and measured its spectroscopic redshift to be z = 6.107 with VLT/FORS. This source may be associated with the putative SMG, but it is most likely offset spatially by 10-30 kpc and they may be interacting galaxies. With a FIR luminosity in the range [5-15] × 1011 L&sun; corresponding to a star formation rate in the range [80-260] M&sun; yr-1, this SMG would be more representative of the z > 4 dusty galaxies than the extreme starbursts detected so far. With a total magnification of ~25 it would open a unique window to the normal dusty galaxies at the end of the epoch of reionization.},

@article{Shapley:2003fk,
	Abstract = {We present the results of a systematic study of the rest-frame UV spectroscopic properties of Lyman break galaxies (LBGs). The database of almost 1000 LBG spectra proves useful for constructing high signal-to-noise composite spectra. The composite spectrum of the entire sample reveals a wealth of features attributable to hot stars, H II regions, dust, and outflowing neutral and ionized gas. By grouping the database according to galaxy parameters such as Lyalpha equivalent width, UV spectral slope, and interstellar kinematics, we isolate some of the major trends in LBG spectra that are least compromised by selection effects. We find that LBGs with stronger Lyalpha emission have bluer UV continua, weaker low-ionization interstellar absorption lines, smaller kinematic offsets between Lyalpha and the interstellar absorption lines, and lower star formation rates. There is a decoupling between the dependence of low- and high-ionization outflow features on other spectral properties. Additionally, galaxies with rest-frame WLyalpha>=20 {\AA} in emission have weaker than average high-ionization lines and nebular emission lines that are significantly stronger than in the sample as a whole. Most of the above trends can be explained in terms of the properties of the large-scale outflows seen in LBGs. According to this scenario, the appearance of LBG spectra is determined by a combination of the covering fraction of outflowing neutral gas, which contains dust and the range of velocities over which this gas is absorbing. In contrast, the strengths of collisionally excited nebular emission lines should not be affected by the nature of the outflow, and variations in these lines may indicate differences in the temperatures and metallicities in H II regions of galaxies with very strong Lyalpha emission. Higher sensitivity and spectral resolution observations are still required for a full understanding of the covering fraction and velocity dispersion of the outflowing neutral gas in LBGs and its relationship to the escape fraction of Lyman continuum radiation in galaxies at z~3.  Based, in part, on data obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and NASA, and was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.},

	Abstract = {The Chandra image of the merging, hot galaxy cluster 1E 0657-56 reveals a bow shock propagating in front of a bullet-like gas cloud just exiting the disrupted cluster core. This is the first clear example of a shock front in a cluster. From the jumps in the gas density and temperature at the shock, the Mach number of the bullet-like cloud is 2-3. This corresponds to a velocity of 3000-4000 km s-1 relative to the main cluster, which means that the cloud traversed the core just 0.1-0.2 Gyr ago. The 6-7 keV ``bullet'' appears to be a remnant of a dense cooling flow region once located at the center of a merging subcluster whose outer gas has been stripped by ram pressure. The bullet's shape indicates that it is near the final stage of being destroyed by ram pressure and gasdynamic instabilities, as the subcluster galaxies move well ahead of the cool gas. The unique simplicity of the shock front and bullet geometry in 1E 0657-56 may allow a number of interesting future measurements. The cluster's average temperature is 14-15 keV but shows large spatial variations. The hottest gas (T>20 keV) lies in the region of the radio halo enhancement and extensive merging activity involving subclusters other than the bullet.},

	Abstract = {We explore the scaling relation between the flux of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect and the total mass of galaxy clusters using already reduced Chandra X-ray data present in the ACCEPT (Archive of Chandra Cluster Entropy Profile Tables) catalogue. The analysis is conducted over a sample of 226 objects, examining the relatively small scale corresponding to a cluster overdensity equal to 2500 times the critical density of the background universe, at which the total masses have been calculated exploiting the hydrostatic equilibrium hypothesis. Core entropy (K0) is strongly correlated with the central cooling time, and is therefore used to identify cooling-core (CC) objects in our sample. Our results confirm the self-similarity of the scaling relation between the integrated Comptonization parameter (Y) and the cluster mass, for both CC and NCC (non-cooling-core) clusters. The consistency of our calibration with recent ones has been checked, with further support for Y as a good mass proxy. We also investigate the robustness of the constant gas fraction assumption, for fixed overdensity, and of the ?= Mgas Tx proxy considering CC and NCC clusters, again sorted on K0 from our sample. We extend our study to implement a K0-proxy, obtained by combining SZ and X-ray observables, which is proposed to provide a CC indicator for higher redshift objects. Finally, we suggest that an SZ-only CC indicator could benefit from the employment of deprojected Comptonization radial profiles.},

	Abstract = {We present Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) measurements of 15 massive X-ray-selected galaxy clusters obtained with the South Pole Telescope (SPT). The SZ cluster signals are measured at 150 GHz, and concurrent 220 GHz data are used to reduce astrophysical contamination. Radial profiles are computed using a technique that takes into account the effects of the beams and filtering. In several clusters, significant SZ decrements are detected out to a substantial fraction of the virial radius. The profiles are fit to the beta-model and to a generalized Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) pressure profile, and are scaled and stacked to probe their average behavior. We find model parameters that are consistent with previous studies: beta = 0.86 and r core/r 500 = 0.20 for the beta-model, and (alphan, betan, gamman, c 500) = (1.0, 5.5, 0.5, 1.0) for the generalized NFW model. Both models fit the SPT data comparably well, and both are consistent with the average SZ profile out to beyond r 500. The integrated Compton-y parameter Y SZ is computed for each cluster using both model-dependent and model-independent techniques, and the results are compared to X-ray estimates of cluster parameters. We find that Y SZ scales with YX and gas mass with low scatter. Since these observables have been found to scale with total mass, our results point to a tight mass-observable relation for the SPT cluster survey.},

	Abstract = {We present an analysis of deep XMM-Newton and Chandra observations of the z = 1.05 galaxy cluster XLSSJ022403.9-041328 (hereafter XLSSC029), detected in the XMM-Newton Large Scale Structure survey. Density and temperature profiles of the X-ray emitting gas were used to perform a hydrostatic mass analysis of the system. This allowed us to measure the total mass and gas fraction in the cluster and define overdensity radii R500 and R2500. The global properties of XLSSC029 were measured within these radii and compared with those of the local population. The gas mass fraction was found to be consistent with local clusters. The mean metal abundance was 0.18+0.17-0.15Zsolar, with the cluster core regions excluded, consistent with the predicted and observed evolution. The properties of XLSSC029 were then used to investigate the position of the cluster on the M-kT, YX-M and LX-M scaling relations. In all cases the observed properties of XLSSC029 agreed well with the simple self-similar evolution of the scaling relations. This is the first test of the evolution of these relations at z > 1 and supports the use of the scaling relations in cosmological studies with distant galaxy clusters.

	Abstract = {A field of 1.013 sr in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS), centered on the south Galactic pole (SGP), has been searched in a systematic, objective manner for clusters of galaxies. The procedure relied on a correlation of the X-ray positions and properties of ROSAT sources in the field with the distribution of galaxies in the COSMOS digitized database, which was obtained from scanning the plates of the UK Schmidt IIIa-J optical survey of the southern sky. The study used the second ROSAT survey database (RASS-2) and included several optical observing campaigns to measure cluster redshifts. The search, which is a precursor to the larger REFLEX survey encompassing the whole southern sky, reached the detection limits of both the RASS and the COSMOS data and yielded a catalog of 186 clusters in which the lowest flux is 1.5×10-12 ergs cm-2 s-1 in the 0.1-2.4 keV band. Of these 157 have measured redshifts. Using a flux limit of 3.0×10-12 ergs cm-2 s-1 a complete subset of 112 clusters was obtained, of which 110 have measured redshifts. The spatial distribution of the X-ray clusters out to a redshift of 0.15 shows an extension of the Local Supercluster to the Pisces-Cetus supercluster (z<~0.07), and an orthogonal structure at higher redshift (0.07<z<0.15). This result is consistent with large-scale structure suggested by optical surveys.},

@article{Gomez:2012yq,
	Abstract = {We present the first in-depth analysis of the massive cluster AS1063. This is one of the hottest X-ray clusters discovered to date and is undergoing a major merging event. The average temperature of the hot intracluster medium has been measured, using Chandra/ACIS-I, and found to be >11.5 keV. Optical spectroscopy, from GMOS-S, has provided a mean redshift of 0.3461 and a large velocity dispersion of 1840+230 - 150 km s-1. Both the large velocity dispersion and high X-ray temperature suggest a very massive cluster (M 200 > 2.5 × 1015 M &sun;) and/or a merger system. The merger model is supported by a small offset between the galaxy density and the peak of the X-ray emission, the presence of offset and twisted X-ray isophotes, and a non-Gaussian galaxy velocity distribution. We also report that the velocity distribution is better represented by the velocity dispersion produced during a merger than by the velocity distribution of a relaxed cluster. Moreover, we find that two non-concentric beta models are a better description for the distribution of the cluster gas than a single beta model. Therefore, we propose that a recent merger event close to the plane of the sky is responsible for the observed properties of the cluster. In addition, optical imaging, from SuSI2 on the New Technology Telescope and GMOS-S at Gemini, has also uncovered the presence of several gravitational arcs that have been used to further constrain the mass and dynamics of the cluster.},

@article{Benitez:2004fj,
	Abstract = {We present the analysis of the faint galaxy population in the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) Early Release Observation fields VV 29 (UGC 10214) and NGC 4676. These observations cover a total area of 26.3 arcmin2 and have depths close to that of the Hubble Deep Fields in the deepest part of the VV 29 image, with 10 sigma detection limits for point sources of 27.8, 27.6, and 27.2 AB magnitudes in the gF475W, VF606W, and IF814W bands, respectively.  Measuring the faint galaxy number count distribution is a difficult task, with different groups arriving at widely varying results even on the same data set. Here we attempt to thoroughly consider all aspects relevant for faint galaxy counting and photometry, developing methods that are based on public software and that are easily reproducible by other astronomers. Using simulations we determine the best SExtractor parameters for the detection of faint galaxies in deep Hubble Space Telescope observations, paying special attention to the issue of deblending, which significantly affects the normalization and shape of the number count distribution. We confirm, as claimed by Bernstein, Freedman, & Madore, that Kron-like magnitudes, such as the ones generated by SExtractor, can miss more than half of the light of faint galaxies, what dramatically affects the slope of the number counts. We show how to correct for this effect, which depends sensitively not only on the characteristics of the observations, but also on the choice of SExtractor parameters.  We present catalogs for the VV 29 and NGC 4676 fields with photometry in the F475W, F606W, and F814W bands. We also show that combining the Bayesian software BPZ with superb ACS data and new spectral templates enables us to estimate reliable photometric redshifts for a significant fraction of galaxies with as few as three filters.  After correcting for selection effects, we measure slopes of 0.32+/-0.01 for 22<gF475W<28, 0.34+/-0.01 for 22<VF606W<27.5, and 0.33+/-0.01 for 22<mF814W<27. The counts do not flatten (except perhaps in the F475W filter), up to the depth of our observations. Our results agree well with those of Bernstein, Freedman, & Madore, who used different data sets and techniques, and show that it is possible to perform consistent measurements of galaxy number counts if the selection effects are properly considered. We find that the faint counts mAB>25.5 can be well approximated in all our filters by a passive luminosity evolution model based on the COMBO-17 luminosity function (alpha=-1.5), with a strong merging rate following the prescription of Glazebrook et al., phi*~(1+Qz), with Q=4.},

	Abstract = {We present a reconstruction of the mass distribution of galaxy cluster Abell 1689 at z=0.18 using detected strong lensing features from deep ACS observations and extensive ground based spectroscopy. Earlier analyses have reported up to 32 multiply imaged systems in this cluster, of which only 3 were spectroscopically confirmed. In this work, we present a parametric strong lensing mass reconstruction using 34 multiply imaged systems of which 24 have newly determined spectroscopic redshifts, which is a major step forward in building a robust mass model. In turn, the new spectroscopic data allows a more secure identification of multiply imaged systems. The resultant mass model enables us to reliably predict the redshifts of additional multiply imaged systems for which no spectra are currently available, and to use the location of these systems to further constrain the mass model. Using our strong lensing mass model, we predict on larger scale a shear signal which is consistent with that inferred from our large scale weak lensing analysis derived using CFH12K wide field images. Thanks to a new method for reliably selecting a well defined background lensed galaxy population, we resolve the discrepancy found between the NFW concentration parameters derived from earlier strong and weak lensing analysis. The derived parameters for the best fit NFW profile is found to be c200=7.6+/-1.6 and r200=2.16+/-0.10 h-170 Mpc (corresponding to a 3D mass equal to M200=[1.32+/-0.2]×1015 h70 Msolar). The large number of new constraints incorporated in this work makes Abell 1689 the most reliably reconstructed cluster to date. This well calibrated mass model, which we here make publicly available, will enable us to exploit Abell 1689 efficiently as a gravitational telescope, as well as to potentially constrain cosmology.  Based on observations obtained at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), which is operated by the National Research Council of Canada, the Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique of France, and the University of Hawaii. Also based on observations from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope (programs 9289 and 10150) obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA under NASA contract NAS5-26555.},

	Abstract = {Modern applications of strong gravitational lensing require the ability to use precise and varied observational data to constrain complex lens models. I discuss two sets of computational methods for lensing calculations. The first is a new algorithm for solving the lens equation for general mass distributions. This algorithm makes it possible to apply arbitrarily complicated models to observed lenses. The second is an evaluation of techniques for using observational data including positions, fluxes, and time delays of point-like images, as well as maps of extended images, to constrain models of strong lenses. The techniques presented here are implemented in a flexible and user-friendly software package called gravlens, which is made available to the community.},

These profiles were obtained based on the well-established fact, that the X-ray observed surface brightness of clusters are described well with the Navarro-Frenk-White density profile of the underlying dark matter distribution. We have found that density and mass profiles for all considered clusters have the same shape. Temperatures, masses and densities of these clusters lie within the ranges 5-10 keV, ˜ 10^{14} - 10^{15} M_{&sun;}  and ˜ 10^{-23} - 10^{-25} kg/m^{3} respectively. We also determined the values of R_{200} and M_{200} for the clusters and estimated the fraction of gas and dark matter in total mass of each cluster to be ˜ 10-20% and ˜ 80-90% respectively.},

@article{Zheng:2012fk,
	Abstract = {Re-ionization of the intergalactic medium occurred in the early Universe at redshift z~6-11, following the formation of the first generation of stars. Those young galaxies (where the bulk of stars formed) at a cosmic age of less than about 500 million years (z<~10) remain largely unexplored because they are at or beyond the sensitivity limits of existing large telescopes. Understanding the properties of these galaxies is critical to identifying the source of the radiation that re-ionized the intergalactic medium. Gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters allows the detection of high-redshift galaxies fainter than what otherwise could be found in the deepest images of the sky. Here we report multiband observations of the cluster MACS J1149+2223 that have revealed (with high probability) a gravitationally magnified galaxy from the early Universe, at a redshift of z = 9.6+/-0.2 (that is, a cosmic age of 490+/-15 million years, or 3.6 per cent of the age of the Universe). We estimate that it formed less than 200 million years after the Big Bang (at the 95 per cent confidence level), implying a formation redshift of <~14. Given the small sky area that our observations cover, faint galaxies seem to be abundant at such a young cosmic age, suggesting that they may be the dominant source for the early re-ionization of the intergalactic medium.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of a strong-lensing analysis of a complete sample of 12 very luminous X-ray clusters at z > 0.5 using HST/ACS images. Our modelling technique has uncovered some of the largest known critical curves outlined by many accurately predicted sets of multiple images. The distribution of Einstein radii has a median value of ~=28 arcsec (for a source redshift of zs˜ 2), twice as large as other lower z samples, and extends to 55 arcsec for MACS J0717.5+3745, with an impressive enclosed Einstein mass of 7.4 × 1014 M&sun;. We find that nine clusters cover a very large area (>2.5 arcmin2) of high magnification (mu > 10×) for a source redshift of zs˜ 8, providing primary targets for accessing the first stars and galaxies. We compare our results with theoretical predictions of the standard Lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) model which we show systematically fall short of our measured Einstein radii by a factor of ~=1.4, after accounting for the effect of lensing projection. Nevertheless, a revised analysis, once arc redshifts become available, and similar analyses of larger samples, is needed in order to establish more precisely the level of discrepancy with LambdaCDM predictions.},

The cluster is detected as a mass peak at 5sigma significance. Its density can be parametrized as a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile with two free parameters, the mass M_{200m}=33.1^{+9.6}_{-6.8}× 10^{14}{ M_{&sun;}} and concentration c_{200m}=2.6^{+1.5}_{-1.0}. We discover a second cluster inside the field of view at a photometric redshift of z ≈ 0.6, with an NFW mass of M_{200m}=4.0^{+3.7}_{-2.6}× 10^{14}{ M_{&sun;}}.},

	Abstract = {We present VIsible Multi-Object Spectrograph (VIMOS) observations of a galaxy quintuply imaged by the Frontier Fields galaxy cluster RXC J2248.7-4431 . This sub-, high- galaxy has been recently discovered by Monna et al. (2013) using dropout techniques with the 16-band HST photometry acquired as part of the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH). Obtained as part of the CLASH-VLT survey, the VIMOS medium-resolution spectra of this source show a very faint continuum between 8700 {\AA} and 9300 {\AA} and a prominent emission line at 8643 , which can be readily identified with Lyman- at . The emission line exhibits an asymmetric profile, with a more pronounced red wing. The rest-frame equivalent width of the line is , relatively well constrained thanks to the detection of the UV continuum, which is rarely achieved for a sub- galaxy at this redshift. After correcting formagnification, the star formation rate (SFR) estimated from the Ly line is SFRLyyr and that estimated from the UV data is SFRUVyr. We estimate that the effective radius of the source is kpc, which implies a star formation surface mass density yrkpc and, using the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, a gas surface mass density pc. Our results support the idea that this magnified, distant galaxy is a young and compact object with luminosity at , when the Universe was just 1 Gyr old, with a similar amount of mass in gas and stars. In the spirit of the Frontier Fields initiative, we also publish the redshifts of several multiply imaged sources and other background objects, which will help improving the strong-lensing model of this galaxy cluster.  This work is based on data collected at ESO VLT (prog.ID 186.A-0798) and at NASA HST.},

	Abstract = {We present an improved strong-lensing analysis of Cl0024+1654 (z = 0.39) using deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS)/NIC3 images, based on 33 multiply-lensed images of 11 background galaxies. These are found with a model that assumes mass approximately traces light, with a low-order expansion to allow for flexibility on large scales. The model is constrained initially by the well-known five-image system (z = 1.675) and refined as new multiply-lensed systems are identified using the model. Photometric redshifts of these new systems are then used to constrain better the mass profile by adopting the standard cosmological relation between redshift and lensing distance. Our model requires only six free parameters to describe well all positional and redshift data. The resulting inner mass profile has a slope of d logM/d logr ~= -0.55, consistent with new weak-lensing measurements where the data overlap, at r ~= 200 kpc/h70. The combined profile is well fitted by a high-concentration Navarro, Frenk & White (NFW) mass profile, Cvir ~ 8.6 +/- 1.6, similar to other well-studied clusters, but larger than predicted with standard Lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM). A well-defined radial critical curve is generated by the model and is clearly observed at r ~= 12 arcsec, outlined by elongated images pointing towards the centre of mass. The relative fluxes of the multiply-lensed images are found to agree well with the modelled magnifications, providing an independent consistency check.},

	Abstract = {Aims: While weak lensing cannot resolve cluster cores and strong lensing is almost insensitive to density profiles outside the scale radius, combinations of both effects promise to constrain density profiles of galaxy clusters well, and thus to allow testing of the CDM expectation on dark-matter halo density profiles.  Methods: We develop an algorithm further that we had recently proposed for this purpose. It recovers a lensing potential optimally reproducing observations of both strong and weak-lensing effects by combining high resolution in cluster cores with the larger-scale information from weak lensing. The main extensions concern the accommodation of mild non-linearity in inner iterations, the progressive increase in resolution in outer iterations, and the introduction of a suitable regularisation term. The linearity of the method is essentially preserved.  Results: We demonstrate the success of the algorithm with both idealised and realistic simulated data, showing that the simulated lensing mass distribution and its density profile are well reproduced. We then apply it to weak and strong lensing data of the cluster MS 2137 and obtain a parameter-free solution which is in good qualitative agreement with earlier parametric studies.},

	Abstract = {Weak gravitational lensing is considered to be one of the  most powerful tools to study the mass and the mass distribution of  galaxy clusters. However, the mass-sheet degeneracy transformation  has limited its success. We present a novel method for a cluster  mass reconstruction which combines weak and strong lensing  information on common scales and can, as a consequence, break the  mass-sheet degeneracy. We extend the weak lensing formalism to the  inner parts of the cluster and combine it with the constraints from  multiple image systems. We demonstrate the feasibility of the method  with simulations, finding an excellent agreement between the input  and reconstructed mass also on scales within and beyond the Einstein  radius. Using a single multiple image system and photometric  redshift information of the background sources used for weak and  strong lensing analysis, we find that we are effectively able to  break the mass-sheet degeneracy, therefore removing one of the  main limitations on cluster mass estimates. We conclude that with  high resolution (e.g. HST) imaging data the method can more  accurately reconstruct cluster masses and their profiles than  currently existing lensing techniques.},

	Abstract = {We present a non-parametric technique to infer the projected-mass distribution of a gravitational lens system with multiple strong-lensed images. The technique involves a dynamic grid in the lens plane on which the mass distribution of the lens is approximated by a sum of basis functions, one per grid cell. We used the projected mass densities of Plummer spheres as basis functions. A genetic algorithm then determines the mass distribution of the lens by forcing images of a single source, projected back onto the source plane, to coincide as well as possible. Averaging several tens of solutions removes the random fluctuations that are introduced by the reproduction process of genomes in the genetic algorithm and highlights those features common to all solutions. Given the positions of the images and the redshifts of the sources and the lens, we show that the mass of a gravitational lens can be retrieved with an accuracy of a few percent and that, if the sources sufficiently cover the caustics, the mass distribution of the gravitational lens can also be reliably retrieved. A major advantage of the algorithm is that it makes full use of the information contained in the radial images, unlike methods that minimise the residuals of the lens equation, and is thus able to accurately reconstruct also the inner parts of the lens.},

	Abstract = {We present a new approach to gravitational lens mass map reconstruction. Our mass map solutions perfectly reproduce the positions, fluxes, and shears of all multiple images, and each mass map accurately recovers the underlying mass distribution to a resolution limited by the number of multiple images detected. We demonstrate our technique given a mock galaxy cluster similar to Abell 1689, which gravitationally lenses 19 mock background galaxies to produce 93 multiple images. We also explore cases in which as few as four multiple images are observed. Mass map solutions are never unique, and our method makes it possible to explore an extremely flexible range of physical (and unphysical) solutions, all of which perfectly reproduce the data given. Each reconfiguration of the source galaxies produces a new mass map solution. An optimization routine is provided to find those source positions (and redshifts, within uncertainties) that produce the ``most physical'' mass map solution, according to a new figure of merit developed here. Our method imposes no assumptions about the slope of the radial profile or mass following light. However, unlike ``nonparametric'' grid-based methods, the number of free parameters that we solve for is only as many as the number of observable constraints (or slightly greater if fluxes are constrained). For each set of source positions and redshifts, mass map solutions are obtained ``instantly'' via direct matrix inversion by smoothly interpolating the deflection field using a recently developed mathematical technique. Our LensPerfect software is straightforward and easy to use, and is publicly available on our Web site.},

	Abstract = {Despite expanding research activity in gravitational lens modeling, there is no particular software which is considered a standard. Much of the gravitational lens modeling software is written by individual investigators for their own use. Some gravitational lens modeling software is freely available for download but is widely variable with regard to ease of use and quality of documentation. This review of 13 software packages was undertaken to provide a single source of information. Gravitational lens models are classified as parametric models or non-parametric models, and can be further divided into research and educational software. Software used in research includes the GRAVLENS package (with both gravlens and lensmodel), Lenstool, LensPerfect, glafic, PixeLens, SimpLens, Lensview, and GRALE. In this review, GravLensHD, G-Lens, Gravitational Lensing, lens and MOWGLI are categorized as educational programs that are useful for demonstrating various aspects of lensing. Each of the 13 software packages is reviewed with regard to software features (installation, documentation, files provided, etc.) and lensing features (type of model, input data, output data, etc.) as well as a brief review of studies where they have been used. Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of strong gravitational lensing data for mass mapping, and suggest increased use of these techniques in the future. Coupled with the advent of greatly improved imaging, new approaches to modeling of strong gravitational lens systems are needed. This is the first systematic review of strong gravitational lens modeling software, providing investigators with a starting point for future software development to further advance gravitational lens modeling research.  http://www.ephysics.org/mowgli/},

	Abstract = {Wide-field optical imaging surveys will contain tens of thousands of new strong gravitational lenses. Some of these will have new and unusual image configurations, and so will enable new applications: for example, systems with high image multiplicity will allow more detailed study of galaxy and group mass distributions, while high magnification is needed to super-resolve the faintest objects in the high-redshift universe. Inspired by a set of six unusual lens systems [including five selected from the Sloan Lens ACS survey (SLACS) and Strong Lens Legacy Survey (SL2S), plus the cluster Abell 1703], we consider several types of multi-component, physically motivated lens potentials, and use the ray-tracing code GLAMROC to predict exotic image configurations. We also investigate the effects of galaxy source profile and size, and use realistic sources to predict observable magnifications and estimate very approximate relative cross-sections. We find that lens galaxies with misaligned discs and bulges produce swallowtail and butterfly catastrophes, observable as `broken' Einstein rings. Binary or merging galaxies show elliptic umbilic catastrophes, leading to an unusual Y-shaped configuration of four merging images. While not the maximum magnification configuration possible, it offers the possibility of mapping the local small-scale mass distribution. We estimate the approximate abundance of each of these exotic galaxy-scale lenses to be ~1 per all-sky survey. In higher mass systems, a wide range of caustic structures are expected, as already seen in many cluster lens systems. We interpret the central ring and its counter-image in Abell 1703 as a `hyperbolic umbilic' configuration, with total magnification ~100 (depending on source size). The abundance of such configurations is also estimated to be ~1 per all-sky survey.},

	Abstract = {We present a revised strong lensing mass reconstruction of the galaxy cluster RX J1347.5-1145. The X-ray luminous cluster at redshift z=0.451 has already been studied intensively in the past. Based on information of two such previous (strong-)lensing studies by Halkola et al. (2008) and Bradac et al. (2008), as well as by incorporating newly available data from the Cluster Lensing And Supernovae survey with Hubble (CLASH, Postman et al. 2012), we identified four systems of multiply lensed images (anew) in the redshift range 1.75 <= z <= 4.19. One multiple image system consists of in total eight multiply lensed images of the same source. The analysis based on a parametric mass model derived with the software glafic (Oguri 2010) suggests that the high image multiplicity is due to the source (z_phot = 4.19) being located on a so-called "swallowtail" caustic. In addition to the parametric mass model, we also employed a non-parametric approach using the software PixeLens (Saha and Williams 1997, 2004) in order to reconstruct the projected mass of the cluster using the same strong lensing data input. Both reconstructed mass models agree in revealing several mass components and a highly elliptic shape of the mass distribution. Furthermore, the projected mass inside, for example, a radius R ~35 arcsec ~200 kpc of the cluster for a source at redshift z=1.75 obtained with PixeLens exceeds the glafic estimate within the same radius by about 13 per cent. The difference could be related to the fundamental degeneracy involved when constraining dark matter substructures with gravitationally lensed arcs.},

@article{DAloisio:2013ul,
	Abstract = {(ABRIDGED) Attempts to observe the earliest galaxies have recently pushed the discovery redshift horizon to z > 7. While direct detection by the HST has so far been limited to the bright end of the luminosity function (LF), in the future the JWST will probe the LF at lower luminosity, closer to that of the dwarf-galaxies believed to dominate reionization. In the meantime, gravitational lensing surveys with existing facilities, like the ongoing HST Frontier Fields survey, are capable of detecting sources that are 10-50 times fainter than any distant galaxy observed to date. In order to realize the full promise of this method, however, observers must be able to measure accurate intrinsic luminosities of magnified galaxies; a capability that depends on magnification maps built from the constraints of strongly-lensed images. Since model builders almost always assume the cluster and nearby (correlated) structures to be the only significant sources of lensing, a potential source of error in these maps comes from the fact that light rays are also subject to weak lensing by uncorrelated LSS along the line-of-sight. The effects of this cosmic weak lensing (CWL) on the magnification maps of cluster-lenses can be quantified statistically in terms of the matter power spectrum. Using a simple model for the magnification profiles of cluster-lenses at z=0.3-0.5 based on the NFW density profile, we show that fluctuations in the magnification of sources at z=6-10 due to CWL are ~10-20(20-30) % for typical absolute magnifications ~5(10). However, the fluctuations rise to greater than order unity near critical curves, indicating that CWL tends to have its largest impact on the most magnified images. Hence, although it is commonly assumed that the effect of CWL is negligible in cluster-lensing systems, we conclude that measurements of intrinsic luminosities of highly-magnified galaxies must account for it.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes the Hubble Space Telescope imaging data products and data reduction procedures for the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS). This survey is designed to document the evolution of galaxies and black holes at z ≈ 1.5-8, and to study Type Ia supernovae at z > 1.5. Five premier multi-wavelength sky regions are selected, each with extensive multi-wavelength observations. The primary CANDELS data consist of imaging obtained in the Wide Field Camera 3 infrared channel (WFC3/IR) and the WFC3 ultraviolet/optical channel, along with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). The CANDELS/Deep survey covers ~125 arcmin2 within GOODS-N and GOODS-S, while the remainder consists of the CANDELS/Wide survey, achieving a total of ~800 arcmin2 across GOODS and three additional fields (Extended Groth Strip, COSMOS, and Ultra-Deep Survey). We summarize the observational aspects of the survey as motivated by the scientific goals and present a detailed description of the data reduction procedures and products from the survey. Our data reduction methods utilize the most up-to-date calibration files and image combination procedures. We have paid special attention to correcting a range of instrumental effects, including charge transfer efficiency degradation for ACS, removal of electronic bias-striping present in ACS data after Servicing Mission 4, and persistence effects and other artifacts in WFC3/IR. For each field, we release mosaics for individual epochs and eventual mosaics containing data from all epochs combined, to facilitate photometric variability studies and the deepest possible photometry. A more detailed overview of the science goals and observational design of the survey are presented in a companion paper.},

@article{Grogin:2011ly,
	Abstract = {The Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) is designed to document the first third of galactic evolution, over the approximate redshift (z) range 8-1.5. It will image >250,000 distant galaxies using three separate cameras on the Hubble Space Telescope, from the mid-ultraviolet to the near-infrared, and will find and measure Type Ia supernovae at z > 1.5 to test their accuracy as standardizable candles for cosmology. Five premier multi-wavelength sky regions are selected, each with extensive ancillary data. The use of five widely separated fields mitigates cosmic variance and yields statistically robust and complete samples of galaxies down to a stellar mass of 109 M &sun; to z ≈ 2, reaching the knee of the ultraviolet luminosity function of galaxies to z ≈ 8. The survey covers approximately 800 arcmin2 and is divided into two parts. The CANDELS/Deep survey (5sigma point-source limit H = 27.7 mag) covers ~125 arcmin2 within Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS)-N and GOODS-S. The CANDELS/Wide survey includes GOODS and three additional fields (Extended Groth Strip, COSMOS, and Ultra-deep Survey) and covers the full area to a 5sigma point-source limit of H >~ 27.0 mag. Together with the Hubble Ultra Deep Fields, the strategy creates a three-tiered "wedding-cake" approach that has proven efficient for extragalactic surveys. Data from the survey are nonproprietary and are useful for a wide variety of science investigations. In this paper, we describe the basic motivations for the survey, the CANDELS team science goals and the resulting observational requirements, the field selection and geometry, and the observing design. The Hubble data processing and products are described in a companion paper.},

@article{Bouwens:2011ys,
	Abstract = {We identify 73 z ~ 7 and 59 z ~ 8 candidate galaxies in the reionization epoch, and use this large 26-29.4 AB mag sample of galaxies to derive very deep luminosity functions to < - 18 AB mag and the star formation rate (SFR) density at z ~ 7 and z ~ 8 (just 800 Myr and 650 Myr after recombination, respectively). The galaxy sample is derived using a sophisticated Lyman-break technique on the full two-year Wide Field Camera 3/infrared (WFC3/IR) and Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) data available over the HUDF09 (~29.4 AB mag, 5sigma), two nearby HUDF09 fields (~29 AB mag, 5sigma, 14 arcmin2), and the wider area Early Release Science (~27.5 AB mag, 5sigma, ~40 arcmin2). The application of strict optical non-detection criteria ensures the contamination fraction is kept low (just ~7% in the HUDF). This very low value includes a full assessment of the contamination from lower redshift sources, photometric scatter, active galactic nuclei, spurious sources, low-mass stars, and transients (e.g., supernovae). From careful modeling of the selection volumes for each of our search fields, we derive luminosity functions for galaxies at z ~ 7 and z ~ 8 to < - 18 AB mag. The faint-end slopes alpha at z ~ 7 and z ~ 8 are uncertain but very steep at alpha = -2.01 $\pm$ 0.21 and alpha = -1.91 $\pm$ 0.32, respectively. Such steep slopes contrast to the local alpha >~ -1.4 and may even be steeper than that at z ~ 4 where alpha = -1.73 $\pm$ 0.05. With such steep slopes (alpha <~ -1.7) lower luminosity galaxies dominate the galaxy luminosity density during the epoch of reionization. The SFR densities derived from these new z ~ 7 and z ~ 8 luminosity functions are consistent with the trends found at later times (lower redshifts). We find reasonable consistency with the SFR densities implied from reported stellar mass densities being only ~40% higher at z < 7. This suggests that (1) the stellar mass densities inferred from the Spitzer Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) photometry are reasonably accurate and (2) that the initial mass function at very high redshift may not be very different from that at later times.  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are associated with programs 11563, 9797, and 10632.},

@article{Beckwith:2006rt,
	Abstract = {This paper presents the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF), a 1 million s exposure of an 11 arcmin2 region in the southern sky with the Advanced Camera for Surveys on the Hubble Space Telescope using Director's Discretionary Time. The exposure time was divided among four filters, F435W (B435), F606W (V606), F775W (i 775), and F850LP (z850), to give approximately uniform limiting magnitudes mAB~29 for point sources. The image contains at least 10,000 objects, presented here as a catalog, the vast majority of which are galaxies. Visual inspection of the images shows few if any galaxies at redshifts greater than ~4 that resemble present-day spiral or elliptical galaxies. The image reinforces the conclusion from the original Hubble Deep Field that galaxies evolved strongly during the first few billion years in the infancy of the universe. Using the Lyman break dropout method to derive samples of galaxies at redshifts between 4 and 7, it is possible to study the apparent evolution of the galaxy luminosity function and number density. Examination of the catalog for dropout sources yields 504 B435 dropouts, 204 V 606 dropouts, and 54 i775 dropouts. The i775 dropouts are most likely galaxies at redshifts between 6 and 7. Using these samples, which are at different redshifts but derived from the same data, we find no evidence for a change in the characteristic luminosity of galaxies but some evidence for a decrease in their number densities between redshifts of 4 and 7. Assessing the factors needed to derive the luminosity function from the data suggests that there is considerable uncertainty in parameters from samples discovered with different instruments and derived using independent assumptions about the source populations. This assessment calls into question some of the strong conclusions of recently published work on distant galaxies. The ultraviolet luminosity density of these samples is dominated by galaxies fainter than the characteristic luminosity, and the HUDF reveals considerably more luminosity than shallower surveys. The apparent ultraviolet luminosity density of galaxies appears to decrease from redshifts of a few to redshifts greater than 6, although this decrease may be the result of faint-end incompleteness in the most distant samples. The highest redshift samples show that star formation was already vigorous at the earliest epochs at which galaxies have been observed, less than 1 billion years after the big bang.},

	Abstract = {The Hubble Deep Field (HDF) is a Director's Discretionary program on HST in Cycle 5 to image an undistinguished field at high Galactic latitude in four passbands as deeply as reasonably possible. These images provide the most detailed view to date of distant field galaxies and are likely to be important for a wide range of studies in galaxy evolution and cosmology. In order to optimize observing in the time available, a field in the northern continuous viewing zone was selected and images were taken for ten consecutive days, or approximately 150 orbits. Shorter 1-2 orbit images were obtained of the fields immediately adjacent to the primary HDF in order to facilitate spectroscopic follow-up by ground- based telescopes. The observations were made from 1995 December 18-30, and both raw and reduced data have been put in the public domain as a community service. We present a summary of the criteria for selecting the field, the rationale behind the filter selection and observing times in each band, and the strategies for planning the observations to maximize the exposure time while avoiding Earth-scattered light. Data reduction procedures are outlined, and images of the combined frames in each band are presented. Objects detected in these images are listed in a catalog with their basic photometric parameters.},

	Abstract = {The eXtreme Deep Field (XDF) combines data from 10 years of observations with the Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) and the Wide-Field Camera 3 Infra-Red (WFC3/IR) into the deepest image of the sky ever in the optical/near-IR. Since the initial observations of the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (HUDF) in 2003, numerous surveys and programs, including supernovae follow-up, HUDF09, CANDELS, and HUDF12, have contributed additional imaging data across this region. However, these images have never been combined and made available as one complete ultra-deep image dataset. We combine them now with the XDF program. Our new and improved processing techniques provide higher quality reductions of the total dataset. All WFC3/IR and optical ACS data sets have been fully combined and accurately matched, resulting in the deepest imaging ever taken at these wavelengths, ranging from 29.1 to 30.3 AB mag (5sigma in a 0.''35 diameter aperture) in 9 filters. The combined image therefore reaches to 31.2 AB mag 5sigma (32.9 at 1sigma) for a flat f nu source. The gains in the optical for the four filters done in the original ACS HUDF correspond to a typical improvement of 0.15 mag, with gains of 0.25 mag in the deepest areas. Such gains are equivalent to adding ~130 to ~240 orbits of ACS data to the HUDF. Improved processing alone results in a typical gain of ~0.1 mag. Our 5sigma (optical+near-IR) SExtractor catalogs reveal about 14,140 sources in the full field and about 7121 galaxies in the deepest part of the XDF.  .},

@article{Eichner:2013kx,
	Abstract = {In this work, we analyze the mass distribution of MACSJ1206.2-0847, particularly focusing on the halo properties of its cluster members. The cluster appears relaxed in its X-ray emission, but has a significant amount of intracluster light that is not centrally concentrated, suggesting that galaxy-scale interactions are still ongoing despite the overall relaxed state. The cluster lenses 12 background galaxies into multiple images and one galaxy at z = 1.033 into a giant arc and its counterimage. The multiple image positions and the surface brightness (SFB) distribution of the arc, which is bent around several cluster members, are sensitive to the cluster galaxy halo properties. We model the cluster mass distribution with a Navarro-Frenk-White profile and the galaxy halos with two parameters for the mass normalization and the extent of a reference halo assuming scalings with their observed near-infrared light. We match the multiple image positions at an rms level of 0.''85 and can reconstruct the SFB distribution of the arc in several filters to a remarkable accuracy based on this cluster model. The length scale where the enclosed galaxy halo mass is best constrained is about 5 effective radii---a scale in between those accessible to dynamical and field strong-lensing mass estimates on the one hand and galaxy-galaxy weak-lensing results on the other hand. The velocity dispersion and halo size of a galaxy with m 160W, AB = 19.2 and M B, Vega = -20.7 are sigma = 150 km s-1 and r ≈ 26 $\pm$ 6 kpc, respectively, indicating that the halos of the cluster galaxies are tidally stripped. We also reconstruct the unlensed source, which is smaller by a factor of ~5.8 in area, demonstrating the increase in morphological information due to lensing. We conclude that this galaxy likely has star-forming spiral arms with a red (older) central component.},

	Abstract = {We report the first space-based very deep near-infrared continuum observations of a uniform sample of z = 6.5 galaxies with log(L(Lyalpha)) = 42.5-43 erg s-1 selected from narrowband line searches and with spectroscopically confirmed Lyalpha emission. The 1.4 mum Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 observations are deep enough (AB(1sigma) = 28.75) to measure individual continuum magnitudes at this redshift for all of the objects. We compare the results with continuum-selected samples at the same redshift and find that Lyalpha emission is present in 24% of all galaxies with M AB(1350 {\AA}) < -20 at z = 6.5. The error in this quantity is dominated by systematic uncertainties, which could be as large as multiplicative factors of three. The Lyalpha galaxies are extended but small (size <1 kpc), and have star formation rates of approximately 10 M sun yr-1. We find a mean L(Lyalpha)/nuL nu at 1400 {\AA} to be 0.08, with the seven objects showing a range from 0.026 to 0.26, implying that there is little sign of destruction of the Lyalpha line. All of the properties of the z = 6.5 sample appear to be very similar to those of Lyalpha emitters at lower redshifts.},

	Abstract = {Properties of dark matter haloes can be probed observationally and numerically, and comparing both approaches provides ways to constrain cosmological models. When it comes to the inner part of galaxy cluster scale haloes, interaction between the baryonic and the dark matter component is an important issue that is far from being fully understood. With this work, we aim to initiate a program coupling observational and numerical studies to probe the inner part of galaxy clusters. In this article, we apply strong lensing techniques on Abell 1703, a massive X-ray luminous galaxy cluster at z = 0.28. Our analysis is based on imaging data from both the space and ground in 8 bands, complemented by a spectroscopic survey. Abell 1703 is rather circular from the general shape of its multiply imaged systems and is dominated by a giant elliptical cD galaxy in its centre. This cluster exhibits a remarkable bright central ring formed by 4 images at z_spec = 0.888 only 5-13 arcsec away from the cD centre. This unique feature offers a rare lensing constrain for probing the central mass distribution. The stellar contribution from the cD galaxy (˜1.25 × 1012 Msun within 30 kpc) is accounted for in our parametric mass modelling, and the underlying smooth dark matter component distribution is described using a generalized nfw profile parametrized with a central logarithmic slope alpha. The rms of our mass model in the image plane is equal to 1.4 arcsec. We find that within the range where observational constraints are present (from  20 kpc to  210 kpc), alpha is equal to 1.09+0.05-0.11 (3sigma confidence level). The concentration parameter is equal to c200   3.5, and the scale radius is constrained to be larger than the region where observational constraints are available (rs =730^+15-75 kpc). The 2D mass is equal to {M} (210 kpc) = 2.4 × 1014 Msun. However, we cannot draw any conclusions on cosmological models at this point since we lack results from realistic numerical simulations containing baryons to make a proper comparison. We advocate the need for a large sample of well observed (and well constrained) and simulated unimodal relaxed galaxy clusters in order to make reliable comparisons and to potentially provide a test of cosmological models.

	Abstract = {In this paper, we describe a procedure for modelling strong lensing galaxy clusters with parametric methods, and to rank models quantitatively using the Bayesian evidence. We use a publicly available Markov chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) sampler ('bayesys'), allowing us to avoid local minima in the likelihood functions. To illustrate the power of the MCMC technique, we simulate three clusters of galaxies, each composed of a cluster-scale halo and a set of perturbing galaxy-scale subhalos. We ray-trace three light beams through each model to produce a catalogue of multiple images, and then use the MCMC sampler to recover the model parameters in the three different lensing configurations. We find that, for typical Hubble Space Telescope (HST)-quality imaging data, the total mass in the Einstein radius is recovered with ~1 5% error according to the considered lensing configuration. However, we find that the mass of the galaxies is strongly degenerated with the cluster mass when no multiple images appear in the cluster centre. The mass of the galaxies is generally recovered with a 20% error, largely due to the poorly constrained cut-off radius. Finally, we describe how to rank models quantitatively using the Bayesian evidence. We confirm the ability of strong lensing to constrain the mass profile in the central region of galaxy clusters in this way. Ultimately, such a method applied to strong lensing clusters with a very large number of multiple images may provide unique geometrical constraints on cosmology. The implementation of the MCMC sampler used in this paper has been done within the framework of the lenstool software package, which is publicly availablewww.oamp.fr/cosmology/lenstool..},

@article{Kneib:2011qy,
	Abstract = {Clusters of galaxies are the most recently assembled, massive, bound structures in the Universe. As predicted by General Relativity, given their masses, clusters strongly deform space-time in their vicinity. Clusters act as some of the most powerful gravitational lenses in the Universe. Light rays traversing through clusters from distant sources are hence deflected, and the resulting images of these distant objects therefore appear distorted and magnified. Lensing by clusters occurs in two regimes, each with unique observational signatures. The strong lensing regime is characterized by effects readily seen by eye, namely, the production of giant arcs, multiple images, and arclets. The weak lensing regime is characterized by small deformations in the shapes of background galaxies only detectable statistically. Cluster lenses have been exploited successfully to address several important current questions in cosmology: (i) the study of the lens(es)---understanding cluster mass distributions and issues pertaining to cluster formation and evolution, as well as constraining the nature of dark matter; (ii) the study of the lensed objects---probing the properties of the background lensed galaxy population---which is statistically at higher redshifts and of lower intrinsic luminosity thus enabling the probing of galaxy formation at the earliest times right up to the Dark Ages; and (iii) the study of the geometry of the Universe---as the strength of lensing depends on the ratios of angular diameter distances between the lens, source and observer, lens deflections are sensitive to the value of cosmological parameters and offer a powerful geometric tool to probe Dark Energy. In this review, we present the basics of cluster lensing and provide a current status report of the field.},

	Abstract = {The Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH) is a 524-orbit Multi-Cycle Treasury Program to use the gravitational lensing properties of 25 galaxy clusters to accurately constrain their mass distributions. The survey, described in detail in this paper, will definitively establish the degree of concentration of dark matter in the cluster cores, a key prediction of structure formation models. The CLASH cluster sample is larger and less biased than current samples of space-based imaging studies of clusters to similar depth, as we have minimized lensing-based selection that favors systems with overly dense cores. Specifically, 20 CLASH clusters are solely X-ray selected. The X-ray-selected clusters are massive (kT > 5 keV) and, in most cases, dynamically relaxed. Five additional clusters are included for their lensing strength (thetaEin > 35'' at zs = 2) to optimize the likelihood of finding highly magnified high-z (z > 7) galaxies. A total of 16 broadband filters, spanning the near-UV to near-IR, are employed for each 20-orbit campaign on each cluster. These data are used to measure precise (sigma z  ~ 0.02(1 + z)) photometric redshifts for newly discovered arcs. Observations of each cluster are spread over eight epochs to enable a search for Type Ia supernovae at z > 1 to improve constraints on the time dependence of the dark energy equation of state and the evolution of supernovae. We present newly re-derived X-ray luminosities, temperatures, and Fe abundances for the CLASH clusters as well as a representative source list for MACS1149.6+2223 (z = 0.544).},

	Abstract = {We present the results of a wide-field spectroscopic analysis of the galaxy population of the massive cluster MACS J0717.5+3745 and the surrounding filamentary structure (z=0.55), as part of our systematic study of the 12 most distant clusters in the MACS sample. Of 1368 galaxies spectroscopically observed in this field, 563 are identified as cluster members; of those, 203 are classified as emission-line galaxies, 260 as absorption-line galaxies, and 17 as E+A galaxies (defined by (Hdelta+Hgamma)/2>6 {\AA} and no detection of [O II] and Hbeta in emission). The variation of the fraction of emission- and absorption-line galaxies as a function of local projected galaxy density confirms the well-known morphology-density relation, and becomes flat at projected galaxy densities less than ~20 Mpc-2. Interestingly, 16 out of 17 E+A galaxies lie (in projection) within the ram-pressure stripping radius around the cluster core, which we take to be direct evidence that ram-pressure stripping is the primary mechanism that terminates star formation in the E+A population of galaxy clusters. This conclusion is supported by the rarity of E+A galaxies in the filament, which rules out galaxy mergers as the dominant driver of evolution for E+A galaxies in clusters. In addition, we find that the 42 e(a) and 27 e(b) member galaxies, i.e., the dusty-starburst and starburst galaxies respectively, are spread out across almost the entire study area. Their spatial distribution, which shows a strong preference for the filament region, suggests that starbursts are triggered in relatively low-density environments as galaxies are accreted from the field population.  Based in part on data collected at Subaru Telescope, which is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan. Based also in part on observations obtained with MegaPrime/MegaCam, a joint project of CFHT and CEA/DAPNIA, at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), which is operated by the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada, the Institute National des Sciences de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique of France, and the University of Hawaii.

	Abstract = {We present Advanced Camera for Surveys observations of MACS J1149.5+2223, an X-ray luminous galaxy cluster at z = 0.544 discovered by the Massive Cluster Survey. The data reveal at least seven multiply imaged galaxies, three of which we have confirmed spectroscopically. One of these is a spectacular face-on spiral galaxy at z = 1.491, the four images of which are gravitationally magnified by 8 lsim mu lsim 23. We identify this as an L sstarf (MB sime -20.7), disk-dominated (B/T lsim 0.5) galaxy, forming stars at ~6 M sun yr-1. We use a robust sample of multiply imaged galaxies to constrain a parameterized model of the cluster mass distribution. In addition to the main cluster dark matter halo and the bright cluster galaxies, our best model includes three galaxy-group-sized halos. The relative probability of this model is P(N halo = 4)/P(N halo < 4) >= 1012 where N halo is the number of cluster/group-scale halos. In terms of sheer number of merging cluster/group-scale components, this is the most complex strong-lensing cluster core studied to date. The total cluster mass and fraction of that mass associated with substructures within R <= 500 kpc, are measured to be M tot = (6.7 $\pm$ 0.4) × 1014 M sun and f sub = 0.25 $\pm$ 0.12, respectively. Our model also rules out recent claims of a flat density profile at gsim7sigma confidence, thus highlighting the critical importance of spectroscopic redshifts of multiply imaged galaxies when modeling strong-lensing clusters. Overall our results attest to the efficiency of X-ray selection in finding the most powerful cluster lenses, including complicated merging systems.},

	Abstract = {The statistics of gravitationally lensed arcs was recognized earlier as a potentially powerful cosmological probe. However, while fully numerical models find orders of magnitude difference between the arc probabilities in different cosmological models, analytic models tend to find markedly different results. In this paper we introduce an analytic cluster lens model that improves upon existing analytic models in four ways. (i) We use the more realistic Navarro-Frenk-White profile instead of singular isothermal spheres, (ii) we include the effect of cosmology on the compactness of the lenses, (iii) we use elliptical instead of axially symmetric lenses and (iv) we take the intrinsic ellipticity of sources into account. While these improvements to the analytic model lead to a pronounced increase of the arc probability, comparisons with numerical models of the same virial mass demonstrate that the analytic models still fall short by a substantial margin of reproducing the results obtained with numerical models. Using multipole expansions of cluster mass distributions, we show that the remaining discrepancy can be attributed to substructure inside clusters and tidal fields contributed by the cluster surroundings, effects that cannot reasonably and reliably be mimicked in analytic models.},

	Abstract = {We study the impact of merger events on the strong lensing properties of galaxy clusters. Previous lensing simulations were not able to resolve dynamical time-scales of cluster lenses, which arise on time-scales that are of the order of a Gyr. In this case study, we first describe qualitatively with an analytic model how some of the lensing properties of clusters are expected to change during merging events. We then analyse a numerically-simulated lens model for the variation in its efficiency for producing both tangential and radial arcs while a massive substructure falls on to the main cluster body. We find that: <listgroup type="i" id="l1"> <li> during the merger, the shape of the critical lines and caustics changes substantially;</li> <li> the lensing cross-sections for long and thin arcs can grow by one order of magnitude and reach their maxima when the extent of the critical curves is largest;</li> <li> the cross-section for radial arcs also grows, but the cluster can efficiently produce these kind of arcs only while the merging substructure crosses the main cluster centre, and</li> <li> while the arc cross-sections pass through their maxima as the merger proceeds, the X-ray emission of the cluster increases by a factor of ~5.</li></listgroup> Thus, we conclude that accounting for these dynamical processes is very important for arc statistics studies. In particular, they may provide a possible explanation for the arc statistics problem.},

@article{Oguri:2003kx,
	Abstract = {Statistics of lensed arcs in clusters of galaxies serve as a powerful probe of both the nonsphericity and the inner slope of dark matter halos. We develop a semianalytic method to compute the number of arcs in triaxial dark matter halos. This combines the lensing cross section from the Monte Carlo ray-tracing simulations and the probability distribution function of the axis ratios evaluated from cosmological N-body simulations. This approach enables one to incorporate both asymmetries in the projected mass density and elongations along the line of sight analytically for the first time in cosmological lensed arc statistics. As expected, triaxial dark matter halos significantly increase the number of arcs relative to spherical models; the difference amounts to more than 1 order of magnitude, while the value of enhancement depends on the specific properties of density profiles. Then we compare our theoretical predictions with the observed number of arcs from 38 X-ray-selected clusters. In contrast to previous claims, our triaxial dark matter halos with inner density profile rho~r-1.5 in a Lambda-dominated cold dark matter (CDM) universe reproduce observations well. Since both the central mass concentration and triaxial axis ratios (minor-to-major axis ratio ~ 0.5) required to account for the observed data are consistent with cosmological N-body simulations, our result may be interpreted to lend strong support to the collisionless CDM paradigm at the mass scale of clusters.},

@article{Minor:2008fk,
	Abstract = {We study the strong gravitational lens statistics of triaxial cold dark matter haloes occupied by central early-type galaxies. We calculate the image separation distribution for double, cusp and quad configurations. The ratios of image multiplicities at large separations are consistent with the triaxial NFW model, and at small separations are consistent with the singular isothermal ellipsoid model. At all the separations, the total lensing probability is enhanced by adiabatic contraction. If no adiabatic contraction is assumed, naked cusp configurations become dominant at ~2.5arcsec, which is inconsistent with the data. We also show that at small-to-moderate separations (<~5arcsec) the image multiplicities depend sensitively on the alignment of the shapes of the luminous and dark matter projected density profiles. In contrast to other properties that affect these ratios, the degree of alignment does not have a significant effect on the total lensing probability. These correlations may therefore be constrained by comparing the theoretical image separation distribution to a sufficiently large lens sample from future wide and deep sky surveys such as Pan-Stars, LSST and JDEM. Understanding the correlations in the shapes of galaxies and their dark matter halo is important for future weak lensing surveys.},

	Abstract = {We study the statistics of large-separation gravitational lens systems produced by nonspherical halos in the cold dark matter (CDM) model. Specifically, we examine how the triaxiality of CDM halos affects the overall lensing probabilities and the relative numbers of different image configurations (double, quadruple, and naked cusp lenses). We find that triaxiality significantly enhances lensing probabilities by a factor of ~2-4, so it cannot be ignored. If CDM halos have central density slopes alpha<~1.5, we predict that a significant fraction (>~20%) of large-separation lenses should have naked cusp image configurations; this contrasts with lensing by isothermal (alpha~2) galaxies where naked cusp configurations are rare. The image multiplicities depend strongly on the inner density slope alpha: for alpha=1, the naked cusp fraction is >~60%, while for alpha=1.5, quadruple lenses are actually the most probable. Thus, the image multiplicities in large-separation lenses offer a simple new probe of the inner density profiles of dark matter halos. We also compute the expected probabilities and image multiplicities for lensed quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and argue that the recent discovery of the large-separation quadruple lens SDSS J1004+4112 is consistent with expectations for CDM.},

	Abstract = {We identify the largest known lensed images of a single spiral galaxy, lying close to the center of the distant cluster MACS J1149.5+2223 (z = 0.544). These images cover a total area of ~= 150'' and are magnified ~=200 times. Unusually, there is very little image distortion, implying that the central mass distribution is almost uniform over a wide area (r ~= 200 kpc) with a surface density equal to the critical density for lensing, corresponding to maximal lens magnification. Many fainter multiply lensed galaxies are also uncovered by our model, outlining a very large tangential critical curve, of radius r ~= 170 kpc, posing a potential challenge for the standard LCDM cosmology. Because of the uniform central mass distribution, a particularly clean measurement of the mass of the brightest cluster galaxy is possible here, for which we infer stars contribute most of the mass within a limiting radius of ~=30 kpc, with a mass-to-light ratio of M/LB ~= 4.5(M/L)sun. This cluster with its uniform and central mass distribution acts analogously to a regular magnifying glass, converging light without distorting the images, resulting in the most powerful lens yet discovered for accessing the faint high-z universe.},

	Abstract = {We present results of a strong-lensing analysis of MACS J0717.5+3745 (hereafter MACS J0717), an extremely X-ray luminous galaxy cluster at z = 0.55. Observations at different wavelengths reveal a complex and dynamically very active cluster, whose core is connected to a large scale filament extended over several Mpc. Using multi-passband imaging data obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), we identify 15 multiply imaged systems across the full field of view of ACS, five of which we confirmed spectroscopically in ground-based follow-up observations with the Keck telescope. We use these multiply imaged systems to constrain a parametric model of the mass distribution in the cluster core, employing a new parallelized version of the Lenstool software. The main result is that the most probable description of the mass distribution comprises four cluster-scale dark matter haloes. The total mass distribution follows the light distribution but strongly deviates from the distribution of the intra-cluster gas as traced by the X-ray surface brightness. This confirms the complex morphology proposed by previous studies. We interpret this segregation of collisional and collisionless matter as strong evidence of multiple mergers and ongoing dynamical activity. MACS J0717 thus constitutes one of the most disturbed clusters presently known and, featuring a projected mass within the ACS field of view (R = 150" = 960 kpc) of 2.11 $\pm$ 0.23 × 1015 M&sun;, the system is also one of the most massive known.  Based on observations obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the Keck Telescope.},

	Abstract = {We identify 13 sets of multiply-lensed galaxies around MACS J0717.5+3745 (z = 0.546), outlining a very large tangential critical curve of major axis ~2farcm8, filling the field of the Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys. The equivalent circular Einstein radius is theta e  = 55'' $\pm$ 3'' (at an estimated source redshift of zs ~ 2.5), corresponding to re sime 350 $\pm$ 20 kpc at the cluster redshift, nearly three times greater than that of A1689 (re sime 140 kpc for zs = 2.5). The mass enclosed by this critical curve is very large, 7.4 $\pm$ 0.5 × 1014 M sun and only weakly model dependent, with a relatively shallow mass profile within r < 250 kpc, reflecting the unrelaxed appearance of this cluster. This shallow profile generates a much higher level of magnification than the well-known relaxed lensing clusters of higher concentration, so that the area of sky exceeding a magnification of >10 times, is sime3.5squ' for sources with z sime 8, making MACS J0717.5+3745 a compelling target for accessing faint objects at high redshift. We calculate that only one such cluster, with theta e  >= 55'', is predicted within ~107 Universes with z >= 0.55, corresponding to a virial mass >=3 × 1015 M sun, for the standard LambdaCDM (WMAP5 parameters with 2sigma uncertainties).},

	Abstract = {We present a detailed strong-lensing, weak-lensing and X-ray analysis of Abell 2744 (z= 0.308), one of the most actively merging galaxy clusters known. It appears to have unleashed 'dark', 'ghost', 'bullet' and 'stripped' substructures, each ˜1014 M&sun;. The phenomenology is complex and will present a challenge for numerical simulations to reproduce. With new, multiband Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, we identify 34 strongly lensed images of 11 galaxies around the massive Southern 'core'. Combining this with weak-lensing data from HST, VLT and Subaru, we produce the most detailed mass map of this cluster to date. We also perform an independent analysis of archival Chandra X-ray imaging. Our analyses support a recent claim that the Southern core and Northwestern substructure are post-merger and exhibit morphology similar to the Bullet Cluster viewed from an angle. From the separation between X-ray emitting gas and lensing mass in the Southern core, we derive a new and independent constraint on the self-interaction cross-section of dark matter particles sigma/m < 3 $\pm$ 1 cm2 g-1. In the Northwestern substructure, the gas, dark matter and galaxy components have become separated by much larger distances. Most curiously, the 'ghost' clump (primarily gas) leads the 'dark' clump (primarily dark matter) by more than 150 kpc. We propose an enhanced 'ram-pressure slingshot' scenario which may have yielded this reversal of components with such a large separation, but needs further confirmation by follow-up observations and numerical simulations. A secondary merger involves a second 'bullet' clump in the North and an extremely 'stripped' clump to the West. The latter appears to exhibit the largest separation between dark matter and X-ray emitting baryons detected to date in our sky.},

	Abstract = {We perform a strong lensing analysis of the merging galaxy cluster MACS J0416.1-2403 (M0416; z = 0.42) in recent CLASH/HST observations. We identify 70 new multiple images and candidates of 23 background sources in the range 0.7 <~ z phot <~ 6.14 including two probable high-redshift dropouts, revealing a highly elongated lens with axis ratio sime5:1, and a major axis of ~100'' (zs ~ 2). Compared to other well-studied clusters, M0416 shows an enhanced lensing efficiency. Although the critical area is not particularly large (sime 0.6 squ'; zs ~ 2), the number of multiple images, per critical area, is anomalously high. We calculate that the observed elongation boosts the number of multiple images, per critical area, by a factor of ~2.5 ×, due to the increased ratio of the caustic area relative to the critical area. Additionally, we find that the observed separation between the two main mass components enlarges the critical area by a factor of ~2. These geometrical effects can account for the high number (density) of multiple images observed. We find in numerical simulations that only ~4% of the clusters (with M vir >= 6 × 1014 h -1 M &sun;) exhibit critical curves as elongated as in M0416.},

	Abstract = {The present physical definition of nearby giant extragalactic and Galactic H II regions on the basis of Balmer emission line and radio continuum maps exhibits luminosities, masses, and densities which range over several orders of magnitude, despite the relatively narrow range of galaxies studied. By combining maps of the extragalactic H II regions with radio continuum maps of the largest Galactic objects, comparisons at similar spatial resolutions have become possible. It is noted that despite the large variation in structure and integrated properties of the largest H II regions in different galaxies, the properties of objects in any individual galaxy are relatively homogeneous. This suggests that the galactic environment is an important parameter, influencing the structure and evolution of the H II regions.},

	Abstract = {Massive galaxies in the early Universe have been shown to be forming stars at surprisingly high rates. Prominent examples are dust-obscured galaxies which are luminous when observed at sub-millimetre wavelengths and which may be forming stars at a rate of 1,000 solar masses (Msolar) per year. These intense bursts of star formation are believed to be driven by mergers between gas-rich galaxies. Probing the properties of individual star-forming regions within these galaxies, however, is beyond the spatial resolution and sensitivity of even the largest telescopes at present. Here we report observations of the sub-millimetre galaxy SMMJ2135-0102 at redshift z = 2.3259, which has been gravitationally magnified by a factor of 32 by a massive foreground galaxy cluster lens. This magnification, when combined with high-resolution sub-millimetre imaging, resolves the star-forming regions at a linear scale of only 100parsecs. We find that the luminosity densities of these star-forming regions are comparable to the dense cores of giant molecular clouds in the local Universe, but they are about a hundred times larger and 107 times more luminous. Although vigorously star-forming, the underlying physics of the star-formation processes at z~2 appears to be similar to that seen in local galaxies, although the energetics are unlike anything found in the present-day Universe.},

@article{Genzel:2011ys,
	Abstract = {We have studied the properties of giant star-forming clumps in five z ~ 2 star-forming disks with deep SINFONI AO spectroscopy at the ESO VLT. The clumps reside in disk regions where the Toomre Q-parameter is below unity, consistent with their being bound and having formed from gravitational instability. Broad Halpha/[N II] line wings demonstrate that the clumps are launching sites of powerful outflows. The inferred outflow rates are comparable to or exceed the star formation rates, in one case by a factor of eight. Typical clumps may lose a fraction of their original gas by feedback in a few hundred million years, allowing them to migrate into the center. The most active clumps may lose much of their mass and disrupt in the disk. The clumps leave a modest imprint on the gas kinematics. Velocity gradients across the clumps are 10-40 km s-1 kpc-1, similar to the galactic rotation gradients. Given beam smearing and clump sizes, these gradients may be consistent with significant rotational support in typical clumps. Extreme clumps may not be rotationally supported; either they are not virialized or they are predominantly pressure supported. The velocity dispersion is spatially rather constant and increases only weakly with star formation surface density. The large velocity dispersions may be driven by the release of gravitational energy, either at the outer disk/accreting streams interface, and/or by the clump migration within the disk. Spatial variations in the inferred gas phase oxygen abundance are broadly consistent with inside-out growing disks, and/or with inward migration of the clumps.

	Abstract = {We measure the photometric properties of 105 giant arcs that were identified in systematic searches for galaxy-cluster-scale strong lenses in the Second Red-Sequence Cluster Survey and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The cluster lenses span 0.2 < zl < 1.2 in redshift, with a median \bar{z}_{l}=0.58. Using broadband color criteria we sort the entire arc sample into redshift bins based on u-g and g-r colors, and also r-z colors for the ~90% of arcs that have z-band data. This analysis yields broad redshift constraints with 71+5 - 4% of the arcs at z >= 1.0, 64+6 - 4% at z >= 1.4, 56+5 - 4% at z >= 1.9, and 21+4 - 2% at z >= 2.7. The remaining 29+03 - 5% have z < 1. The inferred median redshift is \bar{z}_{s} = 2.0+/- 0.1, in good agreement with a previous determination from a smaller sample of brighter arcs (g <~ 22.5). This agreement confirms that zs = 2.0 $\pm$ 0.1 is the typical redshift for giant arcs with g <~ 24 that are produced by cluster-scale strong lenses and that there is no evidence for strong evolution in the redshift distribution of arcs over a wide range of g-band magnitudes (20 <= g <=24). Establishing that half of all giant arcs are at z >~ 2 contributes significantly toward relieving the tension between the number of arcs observed and the number expected in a LambdaCDM cosmology, but there is considerable evidence to suggest that a discrepancy persists. Additionally, this work confirms that forthcoming large samples of giant arcs will supply the observational community with many magnified galaxies at z >~ 2.

	Abstract = {We discuss new observational constraints on the abundance of faint high-redshift Lyalpha emitters secured from a deep Keck near-infrared spectroscopic survey that utilizes the strong magnification provided by lensing galaxy clusters. In each of nine clusters, we have undertaken a systematic ``blind'' search for line emission with NIRSPEC in the J band within carefully selected regions that offer very high magnifications (>~10×-50×) for background sources with redshifts z~=10. The high magnification enables the detection of emission at unprecedented flux limits (1041-1042 ergs s-1). As the comoving volumes probed are small, our survey is designed to address the important question of whether low-luminosity galaxies could provide the dominant ionizing flux at z~10. Our survey has yielded six promising (>5 sigma) candidate Lyalpha emitters that lie between z=8.7 and z=10.2. We carefully discuss the validity of our detections and the likelihood that the detected line is Lyalpha in light of earlier, apparently false, claims. Lower redshift line interpretations can be excluded, with reasonable assumptions, through the nondetection of secondary emission in further spectroscopy undertaken with LRIS and NIRSPEC. Nonetheless, as a result of our tests, we argue that at least two of our candidates are likely to be at z~=10. Given the small survey volume, this suggests there is a large abundance of low-luminosity star-forming sources at z~=8-10. While the predicted reionization photon budget depends upon a large number of physical assumptions, our first glimpse at the z~=10 universe suggests that low-luminosity star-forming galaxies contribute a significant proportion of the UV photons necessary for cosmic reionization.},

	Abstract = {We report the discovery of seven new, very bright gravitational lens systems from our ongoing gravitational lens search, the Sloan Bright Arcs Survey (SBAS). Two of the systems are confirmed to have high source redshifts z = 2.19 and z = 2.94. Three other systems lie at intermediate redshift with z = 1.33, 1.82, 1.93 and two systems are at low redshift z = 0.66, 0.86. The lensed source galaxies in all of these systems are bright, with i-band magnitudes ranging from 19.73 to 22.06. We present the spectrum of each of the source galaxies in these systems along with estimates of the Einstein radius for each system. The foreground lens in most systems is identified by a red sequence based cluster finder as a galaxy group; one system is identified as a moderately rich cluster. In total, SBAS has now discovered 19 strong lens systems in the SDSS imaging data, 8 of which are among the highest surface brightness z ~= 2-3 galaxies known.},

@article{Jones:2010uq,
	Abstract = {We present spatially resolved dynamics for six strongly lensed star-forming galaxies at z = 1.7-3.1, each enlarged by a linear magnification factor of ~×8. Using the Keck laser guide star AO system and the OH-Suppressing Infra-Red Imaging Spectrograph integral field unit spectrograph, we resolve kinematic and morphological detail in our sample with an unprecedented fidelity, in some cases achieving spatial resolutions of ~=100pc. With one exception our sources have diameters ranging from 1 to 7 kpc, integrated star formation rates of 2-40Msolaryr-1 (uncorrected for extinction) and dynamical masses of 109.7-10.3Msolar. With this exquisite resolution, we find that four of the six galaxies display coherent velocity fields consistent with a simple rotating disc model. Our model fits imply ratios for the systemic to random motion, Vc sini/sigma, ranging from 0.5 to 1.3 and Toomre disc parameters Q < 1. The large fraction of well-ordered velocity fields in our sample is consistent with data analysed for larger, more luminous sources at this redshift. We demonstrate that the apparent contradiction with earlier dynamical results published for unlensed compact sources arises from the considerably improved spatial resolution and sampling uniquely provided by the combination of adaptive optics and strong gravitational lensing. Our high-resolution data further reveal that all six galaxies contain multiple giant star-forming HII regions whose resolved diameters are in the range 300 pc to 1.0 kpc, consistent with the Jeans length expected in the case of dispersion support. From the kinematic data, we calculate that these regions have dynamical masses of 108.8-9.5Msolar, also in agreement with local data. However, the density of star formation in these regions is ~100× higher than observed in local spirals; such high values are only seen in the most luminous local starbursts. The global dynamics and demographics of star formation in these HII regions suggest that vigorous star formation is primarily governed by gravitational instability in primitive rotating discs. The physical insight provided by the combination of adaptive optics and gravitational lensing suggests it will be highly valuable to locate many more strongly lensed distant galaxies with high star formation rates before the era of the next-generation ground-based telescopes when such observations will become routine.},

@article{Bernardi:2003lr,
	Abstract = {A magnitude-limited sample of nearly 9000 early-type galaxies in the redshift range 0.01<=z<=0.3 was selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) using morphological and spectral criteria. The fundamental plane relation in this sample is Ro~sigma1.49+/-0.05I-0.75+/-0.01o in the r* band. It is approximately the same in the g*, i*, and z* bands. Relative to the population at the median redshift in the sample, galaxies at lower and higher redshifts have evolved only a little. If the fundamental plane is used to quantify this evolution, then the apparent magnitude limit can masquerade as evolution; once this selection effect has been accounted for, the evolution is consistent with that of a passively evolving population that formed the bulk of its stars about 9 Gyr ago. One of the principal advantages of the SDSS sample over previous samples is that the galaxies in it lie in environments ranging from isolation in the field to the dense cores of clusters. The fundamental plane shows that galaxies in dense regions are slightly different from galaxies in less dense regions.},

	Abstract = {We measure the relative evolution of the number of bright and faint (as faint as 0.05L*) red galaxies in a sample of 28 clusters, out of which 16 are at 0.50 <= z <= 1.27, all observed through a pair of filters bracketing the 4000-{\AA} break rest frame. The abundance of red galaxies, relative to bright ones, is constant over all the studied redshift range, 0 < z < 1.3, and rules out a differential evolution between bright and faint red galaxies as large as claimed in some past works. Faint red galaxies are largely assembled and in place at z = 1.3 and their abundance does not depend on cluster mass, parametrized by velocity dispersion or X-ray luminosity. Our analysis, with respect to the previous one, samples a wider redshift range, minimizes systematics and put a more attention to statistical issues, keeping at the same time a large number of clusters.},

	Abstract = {We study the constraints on the density profile of the mass in a cluster of galaxies that can be obtained when a radial arc produced by gravitational lensing is observed. We apply this to the cluster MS 2137-23, which contains a radial arc, a tangential arc, and three other arclets. As shown by Mellier and coworkers, the positions and elongations of all these five images are well reproduced as arising from two different background galaxies, if the mass distribution in the cluster is elliptical, is exactly centered on the brightest cluster galaxy, and has the same ellipticity and position angle as this galaxy. The galaxy is therefore identified as the center of the cluster potential well. We show that the ratio thetar/thetai of the distance from the radial arc to the center of the cluster to the distance from the other image of the same source to the center gives a powerful constraint on the form of the dark matter density profile. Models that are favored have well-defined core radii of approximately 30/h kpc, with the slope changing rapidly from almost flat to roughly isothermal around this radius. All the models for the density profile that are consistent with the observed position of the radial arc predict a velocity dispersion for the cluster galaxies of approximately 1200 km/s and a central velocity dispersion for the stars of approximately 350 km/s, consistent with the observed velocity dispersions in other cD galaxies. The models also predict that the velocity dispersion of the cD halo should rise rapidly with radius and that the two sources producing the five arcs should be at similar redshifts. This can be tested by future observations.},

	Abstract = {We present a strong lensing (SL) mass model of A1689 which resolves substructures an estimated 25 kpc across within the central ~400 kpc diameter. We achieve this resolution by perfectly reproducing the observed (strongly lensed) input positions of 168 multiple images of 55 knots residing within 135 images of 42 galaxies. Our model makes no assumptions about light tracing mass, yet we reproduce the brightest visible structures with some slight deviations. A1689 remains one of the strongest known lenses on the sky, with an Einstein radius of RE = 47farcs0 $\pm$ 1farcs2 (143+3 -4 kpc) for a lensed source at zs = 2. We find that a single Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) or S{\'e}rsic profile yields a good fit simultaneously (with only slight tension) to both our SL mass model and published weak lensing (WL) measurements at larger radius (out to the virial radius). According to this NFW fit, A1689 has a mass of M vir = 2.0+0.5 -0.3 × 1015 M sun h -1 70 (M 200 = 1.8+0.4 -0.3 × 1015 M sun h -1 70) within the virial radius r vir = 3.0 $\pm$ 0.2 Mpc h -1 70 (r 200 = 2.4+0.1 -0.2 Mpc h -1 70), and a central concentration c vir = 11.5+1.5 -1.4 (c 200 = 9.2 $\pm$ 1.2). Our SL model prefers slightly higher concentrations than previous SL models, bringing our SL + WL constraints in line with other recent derivations. Our results support those of previous studies which find A1689 has either an anomalously large concentration or significant extra mass along the line of sight (perhaps in part due to triaxiality). If clusters are generally found to have higher concentrations than realized in simulations, this could indicate that they formed earlier, perhaps as a result of early dark energy.},

	Abstract = {We study the mass distribution of a sample of 28 galaxy clusters using strong and weak lensing observations. The clusters are selected via their strong lensing properties as part of the Sloan Giant Arcs Survey (SGAS) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Mass modelling of the strong lensing information from the giant arcs is combined with weak lensing measurements from deep Subaru/Suprime-cam images to primarily obtain robust constraints on the concentration parameter and the shape of the mass distribution. We find that the concentration cvir is a steep function of the mass, cvir∝M-0.59$\pm$0.12vir, with the value roughly consistent with the lensing-bias-corrected theoretical expectation for high-mass (˜1015 h-1 M&sun;) clusters. However, the observationally inferred concentration parameters appear to be much higher at lower masses (˜1014 h-1 M&sun;), possibly a consequence of the modification to the inner density profiles provided by baryon cooling. The steep mass-concentration relation is also supported from direct stacking analysis of the tangential shear profiles. In addition, we explore the 2D shape of the projected mass distribution by stacking weak lensing shear maps of individual clusters with prior information on the position angle from strong lens modelling, and find significant evidence for a large mean ellipticity with the best-fitting value of <e>= 0.47 $\pm$ 0.06 for the mass distribution of the stacked sample. We find that the luminous cluster member galaxy distribution traces the overall mass distribution very well, although the distribution of fainter cluster galaxies appears to be more extended than the total mass.   a Photometric redshifts estimated from the SDSS data, as spectroscopic cluster redshifts are not available for these clusters.  b Based on the spectroscopy of the brightest cluster galaxy at Apache Point Observatory 3.5-m telescope.  c We use deep Rc-band images retrieved from SMOKA instead of obtaining r-band follow-up images. This field includes two separate cluster cores, both of which act as strong lenses.  d Based on the new spectroscopic observation with Gemini/GMOS conducted after the publication of Bayliss et al.

	Abstract = {Current efforts in observational cosmology are focused on characterizing the mass-energy content of the Universe. We present results from a geometric test based on strong lensing in galaxy clusters. Based on Hubble Space Telescope images and extensive ground-based spectroscopic follow-up of the massive galaxy cluster Abell 1689, we used a parametric model to simultaneously constrain the cluster mass distribution and dark energy equation of state. Combining our cosmological constraints with those from X-ray clusters and the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 5-year data gives {\Omega}m = 0.25 +/- 0.05 and wx = -0.97 +/- 0.07 which are consistent with results from other methods. Inclusion of our method with all other techniques available brings down the current 2{\sigma} contours on the dark energy equation of state parameter wx by about 30%.},

	Abstract = {We propose a novel technique to refine the modelling of galaxy cluster mass distribution using gravitational lensing. The idea is to combine the strengths of both `parametric' and `non-parametric' methods to improve the quality of the fit. We develop a multiscale model that allows sharper contrast in regions of higher density where the number of constraints is generally higher. Our model consists of (i) a multiscale grid of radial basis functions with physically motivated profiles and (ii) a list of galaxy-scale potentials at the location of the cluster member galaxies. This arrangement of potentials of different sizes allows us to reach a high resolution for the model with a minimum number of parameters. We apply our model to the well-studied cluster Abell 1689. We estimate the quality of our mass reconstruction with a Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampler. For a selected subset of multiple images, we manage to halve the errors between the positions of predicted and observed images compared to previous studies. This is due to the flexibility of multiscale models at intermediate scale between cluster and galaxy scale.

@article{Gilbank:2011hc,
	Abstract = {The second Red-sequence Cluster Survey (RCS-2) is a ~1000 deg2, multi-color imaging survey using the square-degree imager, MegaCam, on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. It is designed to detect clusters of galaxies over the redshift range 0.1 <~ z <~ 1. The primary aim is to build a statistically complete, large (~104) sample of clusters, covering a sufficiently long redshift baseline to be able to place constraints on cosmological parameters via the evolution of the cluster mass function. Other main science goals include building a large sample of high surface brightness, strongly gravitationally lensed arcs associated with these clusters, and an unprecedented sample of several tens of thousands of galaxy clusters and groups, spanning a large range of halo mass, with which to study the properties and evolution of their member galaxies. This paper describes the design of the survey and the methodology for acquiring, reducing, and calibrating the data for the production of high-precision photometric catalogs. We describe the method for calibrating our griz imaging data using the colors of the stellar locus and overlapping Two Micron All Sky Survey photometry. This yields an absolute accuracy of <0.03 mag on any color and ≈0.05 mag in the r-band magnitude, verified with respect to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Our astrometric calibration is accurate to Lt0farcs3 from comparison with SDSS positions. RCS-2 reaches average 5sigma point-source limiting magnitudes of griz = [24.4, 24.3, 23.7, 22.8], approximately 1-2 mag deeper than the SDSS. Due to the queue-scheduled nature of the observations, the data are highly uniform and taken in excellent seeing, mostly FWHM <~ 0farcs7 in the r band. In addition to the main science goals just described, these data form the basis for a number of other planned and ongoing projects (including the WiggleZ survey), making RCS-2 an important next-generation imaging survey.},

	Abstract = {We present a candidate for the most distant galaxy known to date with a photometric redshift of z = 10.7+0.6 -0.4 (95% confidence limits; with z < 9.5 galaxies of known types ruled out at 7.2sigma). This J-dropout Lyman break galaxy, named MACS0647-JD, was discovered as part of the Cluster Lensing and Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH). We observe three magnified images of this galaxy due to strong gravitational lensing by the galaxy cluster MACSJ0647.7+7015 at z = 0.591. The images are magnified by factors of ~80, 7, and 2, with the brighter two observed at ~26th magnitude AB (~0.15 muJy) in the WFC3/IR F160W filter (~1.4-1.7 mum) where they are detected at gsim12sigma. All three images are also confidently detected at gsim6sigma in F140W (~1.2-1.6 mum), dropping out of detection from 15 lower wavelength Hubble Space Telescope filters (~0.2-1.4 mum), and lacking bright detections in Spitzer/IRAC 3.6 mum and 4.5 mum imaging (~3.2-5.0 mum). We rule out a broad range of possible lower redshift interlopers, including some previously published as high-redshift candidates. Our high-redshift conclusion is more conservative than if we had neglected a Bayesian photometric redshift prior. Given CLASH observations of 17 high-mass clusters to date, our discoveries of MACS0647-JD at z ~ 10.8 and MACS1149-JD at z ~ 9.6 are consistent with a lensed luminosity function extrapolated from lower redshifts. This would suggest that low-luminosity galaxies could have reionized the universe. However, given the significant uncertainties based on only two galaxies, we cannot yet rule out the sharp drop-off in number counts at z >~ 10 suggested by field searches.},

	Abstract = {We present the discovery of an extremely bright and extended lensed source from the second Red Sequence Cluster Survey (RCS2). RCSGA 032727-132609 is spectroscopically confirmed as a giant arc and counterimage of a background galaxy at z = 1.701, strongly lensed by the foreground galaxy cluster RCS2 032727-132623 at z = 0.564. The giant arc extends over ~38'' and has an integrated r-band magnitude of 19.1, making it ~20 times larger and ~3.5 times brighter than the prototypical lensed galaxy MS1512-cB58. This is the brightest distant lensed galaxy in the universe known to date. We have collected photometry in nine bands, ranging from u to Ks , which densely sample the rest-frame UV and optical light, including the age-sensitive 4000 {\AA} break. A lens model is constructed for the system and results in a robust total magnification of 2.04 $\pm$ 0.16 for the counterimage; we estimate an average magnification of 17.2 $\pm$ 1.4 for the giant arc based on the relative physical scales of the arc and counterimage on the sky. Fits of single-component spectral energy distribution models to the photometry result in a moderately young age, t = 80 $\pm$ 40 Myr, small amounts of dust, E(B - V) <= 0.11, and an exponentially declining star formation history with e-folding time tau = 10 - 50 Myr. After correcting for the lensing magnification, we find a stellar mass of M * ~ 1010 M sun and a current star formation rate (SFR) <=77 M sun yr-1. Allowing for episodic star formation, an underlying old burst could contain up to twice the mass inferred from single-component modeling. RCSGA 032727-132609 is typical of the known population of star-forming galaxies near this redshift in terms of its age and stellar mass. Its large magnification and spatial extent provide a unique opportunity to study the physical properties of an individual high-redshift star-forming galaxy in great detail, opening up a new window to the process of galaxy evolution between z = 1.7 and our local universe.

	Abstract = {We present a comprehensive analysis of the rest-frame UV to near-IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and rest-frame optical spectra of four of the brightest gravitationally lensed galaxies in the literature: RCSGA 032727-132609 at z = 1.70, MS1512-cB58 at z = 2.73, SGAS J152745.1+065219 at z = 2.76, and SGAS J122651.3+215220 at z = 2.92. This includes new Spitzer imaging for RCSGA0327 as well as new spectra, near-IR imaging and Spitzer imaging for SGAS1527 and SGAS1226. Lensing magnifications of 3-4 mag allow a detailed study of the stellar populations and physical conditions. We compare star formation rates (SFRs) as measured from the SED fit, the Halpha and [O II] lambda3727 emission lines, and the UV+IR bolometric luminosity where 24 mum photometry is available. The SFR estimate from the SED fit is consistently higher than the other indicators, which suggests that the Calzetti dust extinction law used in the SED fitting is too flat for young star-forming galaxies at z ~ 2. Our analysis finds similar stellar population parameters for all four lensed galaxies: stellar masses (3-7) × 109 M &sun;, young ages ~100 Myr, little dust content E(B - V) = 0.10-0.25, and SFRs around 20-100 M &sun; yr-1. Compared to typical values for the galaxy population at z ~ 2, this suggests we are looking at newly formed, starbursting systems that have only recently started the buildup of stellar mass. These results constitute the first detailed, uniform analysis of a sample of the growing number of strongly lensed galaxies known at z ~ 2.

	Abstract = {We present a strong lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster Abell 370 (z = 0.375) based on the recent multicolour images by Advanced Camera for Surveys obtained as part of the Early Release Observation (ERO) that followed the Hubble Service Mission #4. Back in 1987, the giant gravitational arc (z = 0.725) in Abell 370 was one of the first pieces of evidence that massive clusters are dense enough to act as strong gravitational lenses. The new observations reveal in detail its disclike morphology, and we show that it can be interpreted as a complex five-image configuration, with a total magnification factor of 32 +/- 4. Moreover, the high-resolution multicolour information allowed us to identify 10 multiply imaged background galaxies. We derive a mean Einstein radius of thetaE = 39 +/- 2 arcsec for a source redshift at z = 2, corresponding to a mass of M(<thetaE) = 2.82 +/- 0.15 × 1014Msolar and M(<250 kpc) = 3.8 +/- 0.2 × 1014Msolar, in good agreement with Subaru weak-lensing measurements. The typical mass model error is smaller than 5 per cent, a factor of 3 of improvement compared to the previous lensing analysis. Abell 370 mass distribution is confirmed to be bimodal with very small offset between the dark matter, the X-ray gas and the stellar mass. Combining this information with the velocity distribution reveals that Abell 370 is likely the merging of two equally massive clusters along the line of sight, explaining the very high-mass density necessary to efficiently produce strong lensing. These new observations stress the importance of multicolour imaging for the identification of multiple images which is key to determining an accurate mass model. The very large Einstein radius makes Abell 370 one of the best clusters to search for high-redshift galaxies through strong magnification in the central region.},

	Abstract = {We present a maximum-likelihood analysis of galaxy-galaxy lensing effects in galaxy clusters and in the field. The aim is to determine the accuracy and robustness of constraints that can be obtained on galaxy halo properties in both environments: the high-density cluster and the low-density field. This paper is theoretically motivated, therefore we work exclusively with simulated data (nevertheless defined to match observations) to study the accuracy with which input parameters for mass distributions for galaxies can be extracted. We model galaxies in the cluster and the field using a wide range of mass profiles: the truncated pseudo-isothermal elliptical mass distribution, the Navarro-Frenk-White profile, and a power-law model with a core radius. We find that independent of the choice of profile the mean mass of galaxies (of the order of 1012 Msolar) can be estimated to within 15 per cent from ground-based data and with an error of less than 10 per cent with space observations. Additionally, robust constraints can be obtained on the mean slope of the mass profile. The two standard parameters that characterize galaxy halo models, the central velocity dispersion and the truncation radius, can also be retrieved reliably from the maximum-likelihood analysis. We find that there is an optimal scale Rmax which marks the boundary between lenses that effectively contribute to the measured shear. Lenses beyond Rmax in fact dilute the shear signal. Furthermore, going beyond the usual formulation, we propose a reparametrization of the mass models that allows us to put yet stronger constraints on the aperture mass of a galaxy halo (with less than 10 per cent error). The gain in signal-to-noise using space observations, expected for instance with the proposed SuperNova/Acceleration Probe (SNAP) satellite compared to ground-based data in terms of accuracy of retrieving input parameters, is highly significant.},

	Abstract = {We report the discovery of two strongly lensed z ~ 3 Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) discovered as u-band dropouts as part of the SDSS Giant Arcs Survey (SGAS). The first, SGAS J122651.3+215220 at z = 2.9233, is lensed by one of several sub-clusters, SDSS J1226+2152, in a complex massive cluster at z = 0.43. Its (g, r, i) magnitudes are (21.14, 20.60, 20.51) which translate to surface brightnesses, mu g,r,i , of (23.78, 23.11, 22.81). The second, SGAS J152745.1+065219, is an LBG at z = 2.7593 lensed by the foreground SDSS J1527+0652 at z = 0.39, with (g, r, z) = (20.90, 20.52, 20.58) and mu g,r,z  = (25.15, 24.52, 24.12). Moderate resolution spectroscopy confirms the redshifts suggested by photometric breaks and shows both absorption and emission features typical of LBGs. Lens mass models derived from combined imaging and spectroscopy reveal that SGAS J122651.3+215220 is a highly magnified source (M ~= 40), while SGAS J152745.1+065219 is magnified by no more than M ~= 15. Compared with LBG survey results, the luminosities and lensing-corrected magnitudes suggest that SGAS J122651.3+215220 is among the faintest sime20% of LBGs in that sample. SGAS J152745.1+065219, on the other hand, has an unlensed r-band apparent magnitude similar to that of the "Cosmic Eye," which places it near the mean of LBG survey results over similar redshifts.},

	Abstract = {We present the discovery and detailed multi-wavelength study of a strongly lensed luminous infrared galaxy at z = 0.816. Unlike most known lensed galaxies discovered at optical or near-infrared wavelengths, this lensed source is red, (r -- Ks ) AB  = 3.9, which the data presented here demonstrate is due to ongoing dusty star formation. The overall lensing magnification (a factor of 17) facilitates observations from the blue optical through to 500 mum, fully capturing both the stellar photospheric emission and the re-processed thermal dust emission. We also present optical and near-IR spectroscopy. These extensive data show that this lensed galaxy is in many ways typical of IR-detected sources at z ~ 1, with both a total luminosity and size in accordance with other (albeit much less detailed) measurements for samples of galaxies observed in deep fields with the Spitzer telescope. Its far-infrared spectral energy distribution is well fit by local templates that are an order of magnitude less luminous than the lensed galaxy; local templates of comparable luminosity are too hot to fit. Its size (D ~ 7 kpc) is much larger than local luminous infrared galaxies, but in line with sizes observed for such galaxies at z ~ 1. The star formation appears uniform across this spatial scale. In this source, the luminosity of which is typical of sources that dominate the cosmic infrared background, we find that star formation is spatially extended and well organized, quite unlike the compact merger-driven starbursts that are typical for sources of this luminosity at z ~ 0.  This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile. This paper is also based on observations made with the Nordic Optical Telescope, operated on the island of La Palma jointly by Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, in the Spanish Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos of the Instituto de Astrof{\'\i}sica de Canarias.},

	Abstract = {We present observations of two strongly lensed z ~ 5 Lyman-alpha emitting galaxies that were discovered in the Sloan Giant Arcs Survey (SGAS). We identify the two sources as SGAS J091541+382655 at z = 5.200 and SGAS J134331+415455 at z = 4.994. We measure their AB magnitudes at (i, z) = (23.34 $\pm$ 0.09, 23.29 $\pm$ 0.13) mag and (i, z) = (23.78 $\pm$ 0.18, 24.24+0.18 -0.16) mag and the rest-frame equivalent widths of the Lyman-alpha emission at 25.3 $\pm$ 4.1 {\AA} and 135.6 $\pm$ 20.3 {\AA} for SGAS J091541+382655 and SGAS J134331+415455, respectively. Each source is strongly lensed by a massive galaxy cluster in the foreground, and the magnifications due to gravitational lensing are recovered from strong lens modeling of the foreground lensing potentials. We use the magnification to calculate the intrinsic, unlensed Lyman-alpha and UV continuum luminosities for both sources, as well as the implied star formation rates. We find SGAS J091541+382655 and SGAS J134341+415455 to be galaxies with (L  Ly-alpha, L UV) <= (0.6 L* Ly-alpha, 2 L*UV) and (L  Ly-alpha, L UV) = (0.5 L* Ly-alpha, 0.9 L*UV), respectively. Comparison of the spectral energy distributions of both sources against stellar population models produces estimates of the mass in young stars in each galaxy; we report an upper limit of M stars <= 7.9+3.7 -2.5 × 107 M sun h -1 0.7 for SGAS J091531+382655 and a range of viable masses for SGAS J134331+415455 of 2 × 108 M sun h -1 0.7< M stars < 6 × 109 M sun h -1 0.7.

	Abstract = {We present results from a spectroscopic program targeting 26 strong-lensing cluster cores that were visually identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Second Red-Sequence Cluster Survey (RCS-2). The 26 galaxy cluster lenses span a redshift range of 0.2 < z < 0.65, and our spectroscopy reveals 69 unique background sources with redshifts as high as z = 5.200. We also identify redshifts for 262 cluster member galaxies and measure the velocity dispersions and dynamical masses for 18 clusters where we have redshifts for N >= 10 cluster member galaxies. We account for the expected biases in dynamical masses of strong-lensing-selected clusters as predicted by results from numerical simulations and discuss possible sources of bias in our observations. The median dynamical mass of the 18 clusters with N >= 10 spectroscopic cluster members is M Vir = 7.84 × 1014 M sun h -1 0.7, which is somewhat higher than predictions for strong-lensing-selected clusters in simulations. The disagreement is not significant considering the large uncertainty in our dynamical data, systematic uncertainties in the velocity dispersion calibration, and limitations of the theoretical modeling. Nevertheless our study represents an important first step toward characterizing large samples of clusters that are identified in a systematic way as systems exhibiting dramatic strong-lensing features.

	Abstract = {We measure the redshift distribution of a sample of 28 giant arcs discovered as a part of the Sloan Giant Arcs Survey. Gemini/GMOS-North spectroscopy provides precise redshifts for 24 arcs, and "redshift desert" constrains for the remaining 4 arcs. This is a direct measurement of the redshift distribution of a uniformly selected sample of bright giant arcs, which is an observable that can be used to inform efforts to predict giant arc statistics. Our primary giant arc sample has a median redshift z = 1.821 and nearly two-thirds of the arcs, 64%, are sources at z >~ 1.4, indicating that the population of background sources that are strongly lensed into bright giant arcs resides primarily at high redshift. We also analyze the distribution of redshifts for 19 secondary strongly lensed background sources that are not visually apparent in Sloan Digital Sky Survey imaging, but were identified in deeper follow-up imaging of the lensing cluster fields. Our redshift sample for the secondary sources is not spectroscopically complete, but combining it with our primary giant arc sample suggests that a large fraction of all background galaxies that are strongly lensed by foreground clusters reside at z >~ 1.4. Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests indicate that our well-selected, spectroscopically complete primary giant arc redshift sample can be reproduced with a model distribution that is constructed from a combination of results from studies of strong-lensing clusters in numerical simulations and observational constraints on the galaxy luminosity function.},

	Abstract = {We present new Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3 imaging data of RCSGA 032727-132609, a bright lensed galaxy at z = 1.7 that is magnified and stretched by the lensing cluster RCS2 032727-132623. Using this new high-resolution imaging, we modify our previous lens model (which was based on ground-based data) to fully understand the lensing geometry, and use it to reconstruct the lensed galaxy in the source plane. This giant arc represents a unique opportunity to peer into 100 pc scale structures in a high-redshift galaxy. This new source reconstruction will be crucial for a future analysis of the spatially resolved rest-UV and rest-optical spectra of the brightest parts of the arc.
